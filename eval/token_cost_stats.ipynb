At the time of this commit it was before the majority of the transpiler infrastructure was ported to rust. At that time the pass was ported we had a few one off passes that were ported to rust and we had to manage the Python rust boundary carefully. The pattern was typically to define custom rust data types that provided an alternate view of the DAGCircuit and the target for compilation that was built out of the Python space dag and target. The star prerouting pass was ported to Rust and leveraged the existing infrastructure used by SabreSwap and SabreLayout as the function of the pass on a DAG was very similar to Sabre (finding where to insert swaps and rebuilding the dag where swaps are needed). At the time this was a pragmatic choice to accelerate the pass and not need to wait for the needed infrastructure to be written in Rust. However in practice the performance gains the Rust porting of the algorithm provided were not as large as was originally hoped and now the code of the pass is tied directly to the current implementation of sabre. As the sabre interface layer is being re-written in #14317 this is proving to be a blocker for that effort. This commit reverts the current rust implementation to unblock the sabre refactoring effort.\nIt's still definitely worth porting this pass to Rust but we now have sufficient infrastructure in Rust to write full transpiler passes without Python. We should follow up this PR and rewrite the star prerouting pass so that full pass operates completely in rust and directly leverages the native data structures that exist in Rust now instead of the hybrid approach that ties the is tightly coupled to the internals of the sabre pass.\nDetails and comments\nThis reverts commit b23c545.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

At the\ntime of this commit it was before the majority of the transpiler\ninfrastructure was ported to rust. At that time the pass was ported we\nhad a few one off passes that were ported to rust and we had to manage\nthe Python rust boundary carefully. The pattern was typically to define\ncustom rust data types that provided an alternate view of the\nDAGCircuit and the target for compilation that was built out of the\nPython space dag and target. The star prerouting pass was ported to\nRust and leveraged the existing infrastructure used by SabreSwap and\nSabreLayout as the function of the pass on a DAG was very similar to\nSabre (finding where to insert swaps and rebuilding the dag where\nswaps are needed). At the time this was a pragmatic choice to\naccelerate the pass and not need to wait for the needed infrastructure\nto be written in Rust. However in practice the performance gains the\nRust porting of the algorithm provided were not as large as was\noriginally hoped and now the code of the pass is tied directly to\nthe current implementation of sabre. As the sabre interface layer is\nbeing re-written in Qiskit#14317 this is proving to be a blocker for that\neffort. This commit reverts the current rust implementation to unblock\nthe sabre refactoring effort.\nIt's still definitely worth porting this pass to Rust but we now have\nsufficient infrastructure in Rust to write full transpiler passes\nwithout Python. We should follow up this PR and rewrite the star\nprerouting pass so that full pass operates completely in rust and\ndirectly leverages the native data structures that exist in Rust now\ninstead of the hybrid approach that ties the is tightly coupled to the\ninternals of the sabre pass.\nThis reverts commit b23c545.\n* Add back reverted alt text for plot in docs\n \nSign up for free\nto join this conversation on GitHub.\n    Already have an account?\n    Sign in to comment\n    Reviewers\n  \n \njakelishman\njakelishman approved these changes\n    Assignees\n  \n    No one assigned\n    Labels\n  \nChangelog: None\nDo not include in changelog\nmod: transpiler\nIssues and PRs related to Transpiler\n    Projects\n  \n    None yet\n \n    Milestone\n  \n \n2.1.0\n    Development\n  \nSuccessfully merging this pull request may close these issues.\n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

This PR removes this line of code, and lets numpy handle the broadcasting of phase.\nThis PR also adds a check in PauliList.from_symplectic(..., phase) to reject phase if it is a multi-dimensional array, and a test for issue #13623.\n(For the record, I messed up the commit message in 92161ec. The simpler if/elif case is indeed moved to be first, but in the commit message I mixed up the two cases).\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

         "['This pull request (PR #13624) fixes a bug in the `PauliList.insert(..., qubit=True)` method for length-1 `pauli_list`, which incorrectly set the phase attribute as a 2D array instead of 1D. The change simplifies phase broadcasting by removing a problematic line of code, allowing NumPy to handle the broadcasting correctly. It also adds a validation check in `PauliList.from_symplectic(...)` to reject multi-dimensional phase inputs and includes a test for issue #13623.']",

From profiling there is still significant overhead in substitute_node_with_dag() that gets called a lot by the basis translator. While I could work on mitigating that I think between #12730 and then eventually #12550 will just take care of that. So if we need to do something for 1.2 there we can handle it in a follow up.\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

Please reload this page.\n \n \n \nSummary\nThis PR fixes a number of bugs we have recently discovered in the Python code for the Solovay-Kitaev decomposition, together with @Cryoris and @anedumla.\nFixes include:\nfixed a problem with the rotation axis computation for 180 degree rotations (thanks to @Cryoris for working out the math)\nfixed a problem where the global phase of the returned circuit might have been off by $\\pi$, due to the underlying algorithm approximating not the original SU(2) matrix, but its projection onto SO(3)\nin particular fixed Global phase on Solovay-Kitaev decomposition seems wrong #9552.\nLonger-term, we will deprecate the Python code for Solovay-Kitaev decomposition altogether, and switch to the new improved pass written in Rust that also fixes these problems (see #14203), however for backward compatibility we need to temporarily support the Python code as well, and thus it makes sense to fix the problems on the Python side too.\nDetails and comments\nOther changes:\nThere was a very strange \"back door\" for returning a circuit with the original unitary matrix if the computed matrix is not close to the identity. This behavior is not consistent with the documented description of the pass and was removed. (Or rather the functions to_circuit and to_dag remain for backwards compatibility but are no longer used by the main pass).\nThe GateSequence class used to store both the SO(3) matrix as product and the SU(2) matrix as product_su2, however the parameter product_su2 was not updated correctly in various places (and it was not even clear what to do within GateSequence.from_matrix). As product_su2 was almost not used anywhere in the algorithm (with the exception of one place where its usage did not seem to be correct anyway), it was simply removed to avoid confusion and unnecessary computations.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

This fixes the global phase of the\ncomputed approximation.\nIn addition, the product_su2 matrix in GateSequence was not correctly computed in many cases,\nleading to incorrect values when using this attribute. Since this is not needed for the actual\nalgorithm (and spends unnecessary effort for computing it), this also completely removes this\nattribute.\nCo-authored-by: Almudena Carrera Vazquez <almudenacarreravazquez@hotmail.com>\n \n \n \nFix the tests.\n    …\n \n13103ed\nOne of the tests was simply wrong because the reference circuit has the wrong global phase.\nThe tests that check the gates in the final decomposition should not assume that SGate is included and SdgGate is not.\n \n \nalexanderivrii\n          requested a review\n  from a team\n    as a code owner\nApril 17, 2025 11:26\n \n      \n            Copy link\n \n \nCollaborator\nqiskit-bot\n      \n      commented\n        Apr 17, 2025\nOne or more of the following people are relevant to this code:\n@Qiskit/terra-core\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

Please reload this page.\n \n \n \nOne more problem that I have recently discovered (and fixed in the followup PR #14225) is that the SolovayKitaevSynthesis unitary synthesis plugin caches the computed approximations regardless of the basis set, that is the following code:\ncircuit = QuantumCircuit(1)\ncircuit.rx(0.8, 0)\nunitary = Operator(circuit).data\nplugin = SolovayKitaevSynthesis()\n# First, use the [\"h\", \"t\", \"tdg\"] set\nout = plugin.run(unitary, basis_gates=[\"h\", \"t\", \"tdg\"])\nprint(out.count_ops())\nself.assertLessEqual(set(out.count_ops().keys()), {\"h\", \"t\", \"tdg\"})\n# Second, use the [\"h\", \"s\"] set\nout = plugin.run(unitary, basis_gates=[\"h\", \"s\", \"sdg\"])\nself.assertLessEqual(set(out.count_ops().keys()), {\"h\", \"s\", \"sdg\"})\nprint(out.count_ops())\nsynthesizes both times to the first specified basis set of [\"h\", \"t\", \"tdg\"]. Creating two different SolovayKitaevSynthesis() plugins does not solve this, since the caching is done at a class-level attribute. The fix (many thanks to @eliarbel for the suggestion!) consists of storing a dictionary from the basis sets to cached approximations instead. I am wondering if it would make sense to include this fix in this PR instead?\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

Indeed, in the discussed S/H-case we just get back the empty circuit, which is the correct answer (for some reason I thought that this is not what would happen). I don't think anymore that the main run method of Solovay-Kitaev can return a circuit with a unitary gate, so this change does not even matter.\nFor the record: I do think that it would be best to simplify the arguments to different functions (those that need to take matrices should take matrices and not gate sequences), however I agree with you that there is no point to work on this in the Python space, as we are in the process of replacing this code by a much better Rust version.\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

Since this is not needed for the actual\nalgorithm (and spends unnecessary effort for computing it), this also completely removes this\nattribute.\n* Fix the tests.\nOne of the tests was simply wrong because the reference circuit has the wrong global phase.\nThe tests that check the gates in the final decomposition should not assume that SGate is included and SdgGate is not.\n* reno\n* fix to the global phase\n* bug fix (forgetting that gate_matrix_su2 is not SU(2) was a sequence)\n* adding test\n* Restoring the previous fast code for _compute_rotation_axis based on Rodrigues formula, while additionally handling the case of 180-degree rotation\n* removing old code\n* review comments\n* switching back to using _to_dag and _to_circuit\nI actually no longer think that these methods would ever return a circuit with unitary gates, so it does not really matter\n* Addressing review comments\n* pass over release notes combining the original and the suggested wordings\n* Update releasenotes/notes/fix-sk-decomposition-23da3ee4b6a10d62.yaml\n---------\n(cherry picked from commit 6892608)\nCo-authored-by: Alexander Ivrii <alexi@il.ibm.com>\nCo-authored-by: Almudena Carrera Vazquez <almudenacarreravazquez@hotmail.com>\nCo-authored-by: Julien Gacon <gaconju@gmail.com>\nCo-authored-by: Julien Gacon <jules.gacon@googlemail.com>\nShellyGarion\n          added\n  the \n  fault tolerance\nrelated to fault tolerance compilation\n label\n      Jul 9, 2025\n \nSign up for free\nto join this conversation on GitHub.\n    Already have an account?\n    Sign in to comment\n    Reviewers\n  \n \nCryoris\nCryoris approved these changes\n    Assignees\n  \n \nCryoris\n \n    Labels\n  \nChangelog: Bugfix\nInclude in the \"Fixed\" section of the changelog\nfault tolerance\nrelated to fault tolerance compilation\nstable backport potential\nThe bug might be minimal and/or import enough to be port to stable\n    Projects\n  \nTranspiler\n \n    Status: done\n \n    Milestone\n  \n \n1.4.3\n    Development\n  \nSuccessfully merging this pull request may close these issues.\n \n        Global phase on Solovay-Kitaev decomposition seems wrong\n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

Key fixes include:\\n\\n- Correction of the rotation axis computation for 180-degree rotations.\\n- Resolution of a global phase issue where the circuit's phase was off by π, impacting the accuracy of the algorithm.\\n- Removal of an unnecessary attribute in the GateSequence class that caused confusion.\\n- Updates to tests to reflect the correct global phase and ensure proper functionality.\\n\\nThe PR also notes the intention to deprecate the Python implementation in favor of a more efficient Rust version while maintaining support for the existing code during the transition for backward compatibility.\"]",

It relies on the internal implementation detail about how the to_undirected method works in rustworkx (internally iterates over the edges in id order). But while undocumented it is unlikely to ever change so it's fine.

Which would work (and actually would be slightly faster) but would depend on the internal behavior. What you have here is more robust and a better approach.\n 👍\n1\n kevinsung reacted with thumbs up emoji\n \nAll reactions\n👍\n1 reaction\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

This should work like TwoLocal does.\nDetails and comments\nBecause both ZFeatureMap and ZZFeatureMap inherits from the PauliFeatureMap the problem was with how PauliFeatureMap handles the entanglement lists.  To generate proper entanglement layers PauliFeatureMap relies on the get_entangler_map() (the method which takes 3 arguments) method from NLocal which handles invalid inputs and generates properly formatted entanglement layers. But unlike TwoLocal where we specify rotation blocks and the entanglement blocks as separate arguments, for PauliFeatureMap the paulis are specified as a single list. Due to this, we need some additional logic to handle how entanglement layers are generated from the user specified entanglement list.\nTo fix this I have added a helper method _selective_entangler_map() and also added get_entangler_map() method to PauliFeatureMap. The newly specified get_entangler_map() method will override the get_entangler_map() method from the NLocal class for List[List(int)] or List[List[List[int]]] or List[List[List[List[int]]]] but if any other input is passed to entanglement (like a str full) then we fall back on the method from NLocal to handle those cases.\nWith my fix all the below examples work as expected:\nIf entanglement is a List[List(int)]:\nN = 5\nlayer1 = (0,1)\nlayer2 = (1,0)\nqc = PauliFeatureMap(N, reps=2, paulis=['Z', 'ZZ'], entanglement=[layer1, layer3], insert_barriers=True)\nqc.decompose().draw('mpl')\nIf entanglement is a List[List[List[int]]] (This means that entanglement will change according to reps):\nN = 5\nlayer1 = [(0,1,2)]\nlayer2 = [(3,2,1)]\nqc = PauliFeatureMap(N, reps=3, paulis=['Z', 'ZZZ'], entanglement=[layer1, layer2], insert_barriers=True)\nqc.decompose().draw('mpl', fold=-1)\nIf entanglement is List[List[List[List[int]]]] (This means that entanglement will change according to reps and paulis):\nN = 5\nlayers = [[[(0,1), (2,3)], [(1,2), (3,4)]], [[(1,0), (3,2)] , [(2,1), (4,3)]]]\nqc = PauliFeatureMap(N, reps=3, paulis=['Z', 'ZZ', 'XX'], entanglement=layers, insert_barriers=True)\nqc.decompose().draw('mpl')\n@nonhermitian please review this and let me know if I should make any further changes.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

This is indeed a missing feature or wrong documentation. However, I'm not sure this is the right approach to solving it, as this selection might get very messy if you have Pauli connections with differing numbers of qubits.\nIs there a use-case for which you need specific entanglements? If yes, another approach could be to support a dictionary with {num_qubits: entanglement} pairs, e.g.\nentanglement = {\n    1: [(0,), (2,)],\n    2: [(0, 1), (1, 2)],\n    3: [(0, 1, 2)]\n}\nzz_feature_map = ZZFeatureMap(.., paulis=[\"z\", \"zz\", \"zzz\"], entanglement=entanglement)\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

This gives more flexibility in creating custom feature maps.\nCurrently, classes like TwoLocal, NLocal, and others that handle encoding allow entanglement to be specified using various formats like List[List[int]], List[List[List[int]]], or List[List[List[List[int]]]]. If we switch to using a dictionary for ZZFeatureMap and PauliFeatureMap, could that introduce inconsistencies or issues, given that these classes inherit from NLocal? However, if you believe that using a dictionary wouldn’t cause any issues, I would be happy to implement this approach.\nAlso, I might be misunderstanding your concern, but I’m unclear on what you meant by:\nas this selection might get very messy if you have Pauli connections with differing numbers of qubits.\nThe current implementation works even when the entanglement is layer1 = [(0,), (2,), (1,2), (0,1,2)]:\nfrom qiskit.circuit.library import PauliFeatureMap, ZZFeatureMap\nN = 3\nlayer1 = [(0,), (2,), (1,2), (0,1,2)]\nqc = PauliFeatureMap(N, reps=2, paulis=['Z', 'ZZ', 'ZZZ'], entanglement=[layer1], insert_barriers=True)\nqc.decompose().draw('mpl')\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

However, if you believe that using a dictionary wouldn’t cause any issues, I would be happy to implement this approach.\nIt's good to think about this -- in this case I would say it is fine to have the subclass have a specific behavior, since it does have a special structure and the list[list[list... does not apply here.\nAlso, I might be misunderstanding your concern, but I’m unclear on what you meant by:\nas this selection might get very messy if you have Pauli connections with differing numbers of qubits.\nThe current implementation works even when the entanglement is layer1 = [(0,), (2,), (1,2), (0,1,2)]\nI mean that the entanglement list can (1) get very large if we have all layers in one list, and (2) it can get difficult to read as one could even accidentially mix the layers, such as [(0,1), (1,2), (2,3), (1,2,3), (3,4), (0,1,2), (0,),...].\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

         "['This pull request (PR #12767) fixes the `ZZFeatureMap` class in Qiskit, enabling it to accept complex entanglement structures such as `List[List[int]]`, `List[List[List[int]]]`, and `List[List[List[List[int]]]]`, which previously caused errors. The fix introduces a helper method, `_selective_entangler_map()`, and an overridden `get_entangler_map()` method to correctly generate entanglement layers. This aligns `ZZFeatureMap` with the behavior of `TwoLocal`. The PR also updates typing hints, adds tests, and modifies documentation to reflect these changes. Overall, this increases the flexibility of feature map configurations in Qiskit.']",

         "['This pull request (#13214) merges five commits that enhance the CollectCliffords transpiler pass in Qiskit. The key change is the addition of a `matrix_based` argument, allowing the collection of Rz(pi/2) and other unitary Clifford gates. This improvement stems from suggestions made in prior discussions and aims to optimize quantum circuit transpilation. The update includes necessary tests to validate the new functionality and is classified as a new feature in the changelog.']",

It ensures that neighboring sequences are mutually orthogonal (to avoid collisions, like in staggered DD) but also whether the qubit is a CX or ECR target/control spectator. This is nicely summarized in a figure of the paper, where the different wire colors denote different decoupling sequences:\nThis particularly leads to improvement if a lot of qubits are idle at the same time or if they are next to ECR/CX gates. One important category of circuits in this class are the layers in twirled circuits. This pass also works best if the ECR/CX gate times are the same for all connections, which is almost always the case on IBM devices.\nSome simple experiments show that this pass performs better than the current standard in Qiskit, PadDynamicaDecoupling with an X-X sequence.

The new default is therefore that we only add DD sequences for idle times beyond 2 * (max_2q_duration - min_2q_duration).

But the results of CA-DD look promising on the eagle devices and the overhead can be controlled with the min_joinable_duration parameter.\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

I haven't reviewed the algorithm in depth against the paper, but I ran several examples and the results look OK. Still, I'd like to look into some of the algorithmic aspects a bit more. In the meantime, I have a couple questions and possible suggestions, both not major:\nThe rationale behind the default value for min_joinable_duration is not so clear to me. Also, it doesn't feel very intuitive as a knob for controlling the amount of DD inserted into the circuit. Is there some underlying intuition behind the choice, something that could be added to the docstring to help clarify this a bit?\n'cz' is included in the calculation of the 2q gate length variance in _gate_length_variance. However, the logic for handling spectator qubits does not account for CZGates. Was this intentional, perhaps due to the differences in crosstalk levels between Heron and Eagle devices? If so, this introduces a technology assumption in the implementation, isn't it? I'm wondering if it would make sense to provide a way for users to opt in or out of spectator qubit analysis for specific gate types?\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

It's a knob that lets you trade-off between potentially many short sequences or longer blocks. The default value is picked to ensure that a layer of CX/ECR will not have a lot of short DD sequences just due to the difference in duration. But this is not discussed in the paper afaik and I'm happy to change this if you think there's a more reasonable choice 🙂\nRe: CZ -- The paper only investigates CX/ECR. CZ would probably require a different spectator qubit handling, but this is not explained in the paper and hence not supported in the code. We can add an argument that allows to turn off the spectator-specific logic for CX/ECR.\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

But this is not discussed in the paper afaik and I'm happy to change this if you think there's a more reasonable choice 🙂\nThe reason I treated this is as a knob to control the amount of DD is because of this check:\nif (\n    node.op.name == \"delay\"\n    and not is_after_reset(node)\n    and self._duration(node, qubit_map) > self._min_joinable_duration\n   )\nin _get_sorted_delays.  It skips durations shorter than min_joinable_duration when collecting eligible delays, effectively becoming a filter of idle blocks based on their lengths. This is because shorter delays are not just omitted from adjacency blocks and have their own DD sequences, they are skipped altogether. If we want a truly min_joinable_duration behavior in the \"joinable\" sense, we'll probably want to handle the parameter in _collect_adjacent_delay_blocks.  As for the value default value itself, I see the reasoning for layers so I think it's OK. But now I think that a name that better reflects how the logic is implemented currently is min_duration 😄\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

         "['The pull request #12825, titled \"Context-aware dynamical decoupling,\" introduces a new feature to the Qiskit framework aimed at optimizing quantum circuit performance. The context-aware dynamical decoupling method takes into account the activities of neighboring qubits when selecting decoupling sequences, ensuring mutual orthogonality and addressing specific qubit roles (target/control/spectator). This approach leads to improved performance, particularly in circuits with many idle qubits or those near ECR/CX gates. The new method shows significant enhancements over the existing PadDynamicaDecoupling standard, with promising benchmark results on IBM devices. Additionally, the implementation includes discussions on key parameters like min_joinable_duration to control the insertion of decoupling sequences effectively.']",

It ensures that input parsing functions are consistently applied, eliminating discrepancies between the `generate_preset_pass_manager` and `transpile` functions. The changes enhance functionality and prevent different outputs for the same inputs, improving overall reliability. The PR has been approved and merged into the main branch.']",

The code is very clean and I very much like that it uses the new testing framework. I have left a question about the difference between \"1_clean\" and \"2_clean\" methods (most probably because I have not actually read the paper) and a few suggestions on improving the release notes. I have also briefly experimented with the code and saw that the new 1-clean method adds less 2-qubit gates than the old 1-clean method (which makes it a very useful contribution). As a follow-up we should extend the synthesis plugin interface, including the default plugin.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

         "['This PR (#13922) enhances the MCX decomposition in Qiskit by introducing four new synthesis functions: `synth_mcx_1_clean_kg24`, `synth_mcx_1_dirty_kg24`, `synth_mcx_2_clean_kg24`, and `synth_mcx_2_dirty_kg24`, which operate with logarithmic Toffoli depth. The updates aim to improve the efficiency of quantum circuits by reducing the number of CX gates required. In addition to the implementation, new test cases have been added to verify the functionality and correctness of these methods. This contribution addresses issue #13913 and is a significant step forward in the synthesis capabilities of Qiskit.']",

I agree this issue is a bit tricky but I think your contribution is going into the right direction. :-) Also, thanks for exploring different options for that issue!\nI did not have time yet to look into your code but wanted to spend the time to clarify some of your questions. To give a little bit of context, the output of this procedure will likely not be executed directly on a quantum computer but will prove valuable for investigating compiler capabilities and efficiencies. The problem I wanted to fix with the depth parameter is that the given input graph may not be observed by random_circuit_from_graph  otherwise. Likely the name of depth is not optimal and should be replaced by something like min_2q_gate_per_edge.\nYou rightfully noted that the generated circuits may become quite large but I think this is fine. I suspect that if you have N edges in the input graph and uniformly draw 10*N random edges from your input graph, you are pretty much guaranteed to have drawn every edge at least one. While this implies that the circuit depth of the random circuit can be 10*N occasionally, the circuit depth should be much smaller in practice, depending on the structure of the input graph. If an user decides to assign non-uniform weights to the input graph edges, they will need to accept that the returned random circuit will be deeper.\nI think it would be a good idea to raise an error with a reasonable error message if some of the edge weights are none while others are not none. If all edge weights are none, you can assume the weight of each edge to be 1/N.\nWith respects to resets and conditional operations, you can simply follow the approach given in the original random_circuit function, i.e. meaning make some operations conditional with some probability and regard resets as single-qubit gates.\nSome of your 'reviewer markers'  should actually be comments in your code, it would be great if you add those as you see fit. :-)\nI think the implementation should eventually consider the edge weight as well as consider the depth/min_2q_gate_per_edge parameter, e.g. guarantee that the returned random circuit actually has the interaction graph specified by interaction_graph when depth/min_2q_gate_per_edge is set to one.\nI like the idea to fill unused qubits in a layer with a single-qubit gate if insert_1q_oper is set and otherwise do not use single-qubit gates at all. However, a layer should consist of multiple two-qubit gates (even though the number of two-qubit gates does not have be maximal in each layer). You are also right about max_operands - it is confusing in the way the issue is currently stated. In the future, one might want to include 3-qubit or 4-qubit gates but currently for this issue only two-qubit gates and optional single-qubit gates should be used.\nLet me know if things became clearer and whether you require any other information. Also, if you make modifications to your PR, let me know for which implementation you went for eventually. :-)\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

I also think there should be a couple of more test cases with different types of interaction graphs such as sparse graphs, (almost) fully connected and a couple more random ones. Also, I think it would be best if you reused the code in other test cases instead of copying them.

Now with random_circuit almost back to its original state, I gave a more thorough look at the other parts. Please see my line comments. I hope this will be the last round of changes before we can merge the PR.\nRegarding your performance comparison, it was helpful. It does help with getting a rough sense for the scaling of random_circuit_from_graph compared to random_circuit. If we want at some point to get a better understanding of it, we'll need to explore the parameter space more rigorously. For example, I played with your code a bit and got this:\nqc = random_circuit_from_graph(h_h_g,\n                               min_2q_gate_per_edge = 90,\n                               max_operands = 2,\n                               measure = True,\n                               conditional = False, # Just making it a bit more challenging.\n                               reset = False,\n                               seed = seed,\n                               insert_1q_oper = True)\nqc_rand = random_circuit(num_qubits = 70, depth = 298, max_operands = 2, measure = True, conditional = False, reset = False, seed = seed)\n# For `random_circuit_from_graph`:\n# Time taken: 1.6271507740020752 to generate 19729 operations\n# Time taken per operation: 82.47507597962772 us\n#  ########################################\n# For `random_circuit`:\n# Time taken: 0.5127830505371094 to generate 19067 operations\n# Time taken per operation: 26.893745766880443 us\nBut still it's good to have some sense that the new function is not too far off. I've left a couple optimization suggestions that might help but I wouldn't go beyond that in this PR trying to optimize performance more. We can handle this aspect in a new PR if there will be a use-case for which performance becomes a bottleneck.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

So QuantumCircuit._append could not be used within a control-flow builder context (e.g. within with qc.if_test) since it doesn't look at the current circuit scope, effectively ignoring the control-flow scope here. This is why we don't see the if test surrounding the CS gate.\nSo let's keep the qc.append inside all the control-flow build contexts here and use qc._append elsewhere.

I was able to fix the linting issues but I have a question about the testing. When I run tox I can see one failure when test_random_mid_circuit_measure_conditional function is checked. I think the problem arises because seed=4 yields a different random circuit than it used to for old code. I know how to fix that issue (by changing seed =4 to seed =16 to produce a similar circuit), should I make this change and include it in my PR or should I not change other tests?\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

Please reload this page.\n \n \n \nSorry for the multiple commits, but I am facing an issue with runnin tox - elint locally (I have opened an issue in qiskit regarding that).\n@sbrandhsn I have addressed your comments in my recent commits. Here are some details about the changes:\nThere are formatting issues which causes our CI to fail. Please run tox -eblack and tox -elint-incr locally to figure out what needs to be changed.\nI have fixed the linting and code formatting issues. The CI is able to run all the tests successfully.\nI think I made a mistake when specifying the precedence of max_operands, sorry! Having both set, max_operands and num_operand_distribution set is fine, please revert the initial default value of max_operands. If num_operand_distribution is not set but max_operands is set, draw a random num_operand_distribution and continue with your code or use the initial code.\nNow my code won't raise error when both num_operand_distribution and max_operands are set. And if both are set the code will use the distribution specified in num_operand_distribution. And the max_operands will use the default value 4 (according to the original code).\nPlease add a test case with a distribution that disallows single-qubit gates, i.e. with {1:0, …}. I think some logic around how single-qubit gates are used to fill the non-used qubits in layer would fail such a test case with the current code.\nIn my earlier code if {1: 0, ...} is specified explicitly then: 1) the distribution list will have 0 probability corresponding to the 1-qubit gates in  gates_to_consider and so the np.choice(..., p=distribution) will never pick the 1-qubit gates. 2) To handle how the non-used qubits are filled, I have a slack handling loop, which will only add gates that have a non-zero probability in num_operand_distribution. I have extensively tested these two logics and have also written a test to confirm this. But if you still think this needs to be changed then let me know.\nPlease add a test case with some distribution and specify a particularly long depth as a parameter. This should make your num_operand_distribution match closely what is contained in the returned random circuit.\nI have added three more tests (total 4) which will test if the code respects the num_operand_distribution or not by checking if there are any unwanted gates in the circuit or not.\nAlso, you can fixing that failing test case in the described way seems fine to me. :-)\nI have fixed this test.\nQuestion\nPlease raise an error when max_operands is larger than num_qubits.\nI have commented this above where you originally asked this. But this is how the original code handled when max_operands is larger than num_qubits. Should I still raise an error when this happens? I am asking this because the using max_operands=4 (which was its default value in original code) as the default value, the code will always throw error for num_qubits<4 when user calls random_circuit(num_qubits=3, depth=3). And this is how most of the users call random_circuits() i.e. without ever specifying max_operands.\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

I was wondering whether you have an idea on why the ratios of 1-q and 4-q gates have a larger distance to the specified distribution than 2-q and 3-q gates. :-)\n@sbrandhsn I'm not exactly sure why we are seeing this but here is what I think. The larger distance between 1-q and 4-q gates is because it is easier to fit in 1-q gates and harder to fit in 4-q gates using the current implementation. The function np.cumsum truncates the randomly drawn gate_specs array which will introduce some bias that will lead to the problem we are seeing. And due to this bias the no. of 1-q gates will be almost always be higher than expected and the no. of 4-q gates will be lower than expected. When I wasworking on this issue I did try to come up with a solution that does not involve truncating the randomly drawn gate_specs array but that will slow the code down quite a bit.\nBut if we look at the distribution of gates for a random circuit with 100 and 500 qubits, what I observed is that distance from the expected distribution decreases.\nqubits=100:\nqubits=500:\nWe will observe a similar trend if we just draw a random distribution from only 1-q, 2-q and 3-q gates (excluding 4-q gates). Below is the plot for that\nHere we see the same issue but with 1-q and 3-q gates.\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

Something along the lines of:\n'Since generating a random circuit involves stochastic processes, the provided ratios will not always be exactly matched. Expect higher deviations from the specified ratios for quantum circuits with a small number of qubits and lower depth and lower deviations for large quantum circuits.'\nI was also thinking about giving specific numbers but this seems like too much. :-)\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

However, this format is nominally symengine version specific and will raise an error if there is a mismatch between the version used to generate the payload and what is trying to read it. This became an issue in the recent symengine 0.13 release which started to raise an error when people installed it and tried to load QPY payloads across the versions. This makes the symengine serialization unsuitable for use in QPY because it's supposed to be independent of these kind of concerns, especially when QPY is used in a server-client model where you don't necessarily control the installed environment of symengine.\nTo correctly address this issue we'll need a new version of the QPY format that owns the serialization format of ParameterExpressions directly instead of relying on symengine which doesn't offer a compatibility guarantee on the format. However this won't be quick solution and users are encountering issues since the release of 0.13. This commit introduces a workaround for this specific instance of the mismatch. It turns out the payload format between 0.11 and 0.13 is completely unchanged except for the version number. So before passing the parameter expression payload to symengine for deserialization this commit checks the versions numbers are the same, if they're not it checks that we're dealing with 0.11 or 0.13, and if so it changes the version number in the payloads header appropriately. If the version number is outside those bounds it raises an exception because while this hack is known to be safe for translating between symengine 0.11 and 0.13, it's not possible to know for a future version whether the payload format changed or not.\nLonger term we will need a proper fix in qpy version 13 that introduces a qiskit native serialization format for parameter expression instead of relying on symengine or sympy to do it for us.\nDetails and comments\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

This became an issue\nin the recent symengine 0.13 release which started to raise an error\nwhen people installed it and tried to load QPY payloads across the\nversions. This makes the symengine serialization unsuitable for use in\nQPY because it's supposed to be independent of these kind of concerns,\nespecially when QPY is used in a server-client model where you don't\nnecessarily control the installed environment of symengine.\nTo correctly address this issue we'll need a new version of the QPY\nformat that owns the serialization format of ParameterExpressions directly\ninstead of relying on symengine which doesn't offer a compatibility\nguarantee on the format. However this won't be quick solution and users\nare encountering issues since the release of 0.13. This commit\nintroduces a workaround for this specific instance of the mismatch. It\nturns out the payload format between 0.11 and 0.13 is completely\nunchanged except for the version number.

We don't like introducing an upper bound in a patch release, but we've had upper bounds on symengine before, and the hack we're doing to enable compatibility is pretty dangerous, since symengine's deserialisation code can hard crash on malformed payloads.  It feels safer to try and restrict symengine 0.14 from entering (as best as we can), rather than hoping that nothing will break when it's released.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

The last question before I approve:\nThe use_symengine argument to QPY serialisation was introduced in #10820, released in Terra 0.45.0, which allowed symengine>=0.9.  use_symengine=False was the default back then, but it was possible to set use_symengine=True, and if I set that during the QPY file generation, then this branch will fail to load the files.  I can't just add 9 to the allowed minor versions we can load from, because it seems like between 0.9 and 0.11 the format did change, and we segfault symengine if we patch the version.\nAre we prepared to accept this problem as \"good enough\", or do we want to look for anything deeper?  Ideologically it's not nice to call it \"good enough\", but pragmatically I don't think I can see an alternative solution for us in the short term.  Assuming we accept that issue, should we put a \"known issues\" release note in about it, or potentially document it in the QPY documentation about the backwards compatibility guarantees?\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

This became an issue\nin the recent symengine 0.13 release which started to raise an error\nwhen people installed it and tried to load QPY payloads across the\nversions. This makes the symengine serialization unsuitable for use in\nQPY because it's supposed to be independent of these kind of concerns,\nespecially when QPY is used in a server-client model where you don't\nnecessarily control the installed environment of symengine.\nTo correctly address this issue we'll need a new version of the QPY\nformat that owns the serialization format of ParameterExpressions directly\ninstead of relying on symengine which doesn't offer a compatibility\nguarantee on the format. However this won't be quick solution and users\nare encountering issues since the release of 0.13. This commit\nintroduces a workaround for this specific instance of the mismatch. It\nturns out the payload format between 0.11 and 0.13 is completely\nunchanged except for the version number. So before passing the parameter\nexpression payload to symengine for deserialization this commit checks\nthe versions numbers are the same, if they're not it checks that we're\ndealing with 0.11 or 0.13, and if so it changes the version number in\nthe payloads header appropriately. If the version number is outside\nthose bounds it raises an exception because while this hack is known to\nbe safe for translating between symengine 0.11 and 0.13, it's not\npossible to know for a future version whether the payload format changed\nor not.\nLonger term we will need a proper fix in qpy version 13 that introduces\na qiskit native serialization format for parameter expression instead of\nrelying on symengine or sympy to do it for us.\n* Handle schedules too\nThis commit updates the schedule serialization path too, as it was also\ndirectly loading symengine expressions. The code handling the workaround\nis extracted to a standalone function which is used in both spots now\ninstead of calling symengine directly.\n* Remove unused imports\n* Gracefully handle failure to parse historical symengine files\nDuring the discovery on the fix in this PR we discovered that setting\nthe ``use_symengine`` flag from Qiskit 0.45.x and 0.46.x would result in\nnewer versions of Qiskit being unable to parse the QPY file for the same\nissue as being addressed here. This commit expands the logic to account\nfor this and raise a useful warning. It also updates the release notes\nand documentation to document these limitations.\n* Cap upper version of symengine in requirements list\nOut of an abundance of caution this commit places a cap on the allowed\nversion of symengine users can install to be compatible with Qiskit.\nDue to the symengine version dependence discovered in QPY around\nserializing ParameterExpressions, we'll likely have a similar issue\nwhen symengine 0.14.0 releases. Pre-emptively capping this means we\naren't going to be in this situation until we can confirm compatibility\nwith QPY serialization. The real solution for this will come in #13252,\nalthough as this behavior is embedded in QPY formats 10, 11, and 12 at\nthis point we'll have to handle this edge case moving forward regardless\nof whether we introduce a better solution in 1.3.0 or not.

This\nwas worked around in Qiskit#13251 but this is not a sustainable solution and\nonly works for symengine 0.11.0 and 0.13.0 (there was no 0.12.0). While\nthere was always the option to use sympy to serialize the underlying\nsymbolic expression (there is a `use_symengine` flag on `qpy.dumps` you\ncan set to `False` to do this) the sympy serialzation has several\ntradeoffs most importantly is much higher runtime overhead. To solve\nthe issue moving forward a qiskit native representation of the parameter\nexpression object is necessary for serialization.\nThis commit bumps the QPY format version to 13 and adds a new\nserialization format for ParameterExpression objects. This new format\nis a serialization of the API calls made to ParameterExpression that\nresulted in the creation of the underlying object.

         "['This PR introduces a workaround for symengine serialization payload incompatibility in Qiskit. It addresses issues caused by the recent symengine 0.13 release, which raised errors due to version mismatches when loading QPY payloads. The workaround checks version compatibility and modifies the payload header accordingly to handle versions 0.11 and 0.13. It also includes updates to handle schedule serialization and ensures graceful handling of historical symengine files. Furthermore, the upper version of symengine is capped in the requirements to prevent future compatibility issues until a permanent solution can be implemented in QPY version 13.']",

The consolidate blocks internal logic around whether to consolidate a pass or not is based on the estimate from the selected decomposer of whether the estimated number of gates used to synthesis the unitary would exceed the number of basis gates in the block. To do this the pass counts the gate with the synthesis target name in the block. However, in the case of the decomposer being the TwoQubitBasisDecomposer the name being used for this look wasn't the name of the gate, but instead was an internal sentinel value string \"USER_GATE\" which is used to handle arbitrary user gate definitions in the decomposer. This led to the consolidate blocks pass missing opportunities for consolidation. This commit fixes the oversight so that the name we use for making this determination is the actual basis gate name and the pass functions correctly.\nDetails and comments\nFixes #14413\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

         "[\"This pull request fixes a bug in the ConsolidateBlocks pass of Qiskit's transpiler, which was introduced in a previous update. The issue was due to the incorrect use of an internal sentinel value instead of the actual KAK gate name, leading to missed consolidation opportunities. The fix ensures that the correct gate name is utilized, thus restoring the intended functionality of the pass. This change is crucial for optimizing gate counts during quantum circuit transpilation.\"]",

A couple of passes, but not all, have defensive code in their run methods to raise a better error in this case, but even so, there is an assumption that passes will not be run with coupling_map=None.\nThe preset pass managers do follow this assumption; conditional code prevents those passes from ever being called.  However, we know that there's no coupling map ahead of time, so we can simply not even construct the layout passes, let alone add them to the PassManager.\nDetails and comments\nInput normalisation typically wants to be done in pass initialisation, not deferred to runtime (though expensive properties can still be computed only on first run and cached).  The current strategy of silently ignoring invalid inputs until runtime makes it harder to do this; it's clearer to have the pass-manager construction logic never produce objects in invalid states in the first place.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

When the pass is looking up the preferred synthesis direction for a unitary based on the connectvity constraints the connectivity was being provided as a PyList. To look up the edge in connectivity set this meant we needed to iterate over the list and then create a set that rust could lookup if it contains an edge or it's reverse. This has significant overhead because its iterating via python and also iterating per decomposition. This commit addresses this by changing the input type to be a HashSet from Python so Pyo3 will convert a pyset directly to a HashSet once at call time and that's used by reference for lookups directly instead of needing to iterate over the list each time.\nDetails and comments\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

Profiling the benchpress test using the hamlib\nhamiltonian:\nham_graph-2D-grid-nonpbc-qubitnodes_Lx-5_Ly-186_h-0.5-all-to-all\nthat caught this originally regression was showing an inordinate amount\nof time being spent in the construction of\n`_build_gate_lengths_by_qubit` and `_build_gate_errors_by_qubit` which\nisn't being used because this happens internally in rust now. To\nmitigate this overhead this commit migrates the sections computing these\nvalues to the code branch that uses them and not the default plugin\nbranch that uses rust.\n \n \nmtreinish\n            commented\n            \nOct 29, 2024\n \nView reviewed changes\n \n \ncrates/accelerate/src/unitary_synthesis.rs\n@@ -268,7 +268,7 @@ fn py_run_main_loop(\n                    new_ids,\n                    min_qubits,\n                    target,\n                    coupling_edges,\n                    coupling_edges.clone(),\n \n      \n            Copy link\n \n \nMember\nAuthor\nmtreinish\nOct 29, 2024\nThere was a problem hiding this comment.\nChoose a reason for hiding this comment\n      The reason will be displayed to describe this comment to others.

Not sure how important this is because this only comes up during control flow processing and we're already slower there because of the python usage and circuit to dag conversion. Maybe something to fix for when we make a dag native control flow op.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

The new function names, such as synth_mcx_n_dirty_i15, synth_mcx_1_clean_b95, etc. are reasonable. One small question: once we integrate these into plugins, would it make sense for the plugin names to be n_dirty_i15, 1_clean_b95, etc. as in hls = HLSConfig(mcx=['1_clean_b95`])?\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

However the way the target was being used in this check was incorrect. The name for an instruction in the target should be used as its identifier and then if we need the object representation that should query the target for that object based on the name. However the check was doing this backwards getting a list of operation objects and then using the name contained in the object. This will cause issues for instructions that use custom names such as when there are tuned variants or a custom gate instance with a unique name.\nWhile there is some question over whether we need this check as we will run the consolidate 2q blocks pass as part of the optimization stage which will have the same effect, this opts to just fix the target usage for it to minimize the diff. Also while not the explicit goal of this check it is protecting against some bugs in the consolidate blocks pass that occur when custom gates are used. So for the short term this check is retained, but in the future when these bugs in consolidate blocks are fixed we can revisit whether we want to remove the conditional logic.\nDetails and comments\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

Realistically, the piece that's actually needed here is actually the known check; it's protecting us against issues running ConsolidateBlocks with custom operations that it can't reason about. I need to open another bug about ConsolidateBlocks crashing with custom opaque gates so we can track fixing that too..\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

         "[\"This pull request (#12898) removes an incorrectly implemented check in the initialization peephole optimization for Qiskit. The check was meant to avoid running 2-qubit gate consolidation in the presence of discrete gates but was flawed as it misused the target's operation objects. The PR simplifies the logic by eliminating the check and fixing an underlying bug in the ConsolidateBlocks logic, which previously caused issues with custom gates. This change enhances the optimization process while maintaining system stability.\"]",

Here we are appending the quantum circuit mcmt  to the quantum circuit circuit, yet the docstring for append states instruction: Operation | CircuitInstruction. The code does work, since a QuantumCircuit defines a to_instruction method, which append tries to use when the instruction is not of type Operation. Would it be slightly cleaner to change to circuit.append(mcmt.to_instruction(), ...), or should we change the typehint for the append method?\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

         "['This pull request (#13596) by Cryoris introduces a crucial fix by ensuring that the MCMT plugin is only applied to the MCMTGate, thus preventing erroneous behavior when the circuit named \"mcmt\" is used. This change addresses issue #13563 and includes updates to the changelog under the \"Fixed\" section. The implementation also enhances the testing framework, ensuring robustness around the usage of the MCMT gate. Overall, this PR improves the functionality and clarity of the Qiskit framework.']",

Prior to QPY version 10 this was the only way we supported serializing parameter expressions in QPY. For QPY version 10, 11, and 12 sympy could optionally be used if the payload was generated explicitly to not use symengine (in qiskit 1.0 it defaulted to use symengine).\nThis serialization format relied on sympy to generate a string representation of the expression which we then put in the payload. On deserialization we called sympy's parse_expr() function which internally is calling sympy's sympify() internally. Sympy documents that sympify() relies on Python's eval() for string input and should not be used with untrusted input. But parse_expr() didn't have such a warning (at the time, I plan to contribute adding one), so using this function provides an avenue for arbitrary code execution during QPY deserialization.\nThis commit fixes this issue by writing a custom parser for the string representation in a QPY payload based on python's ast module. This parser walks the abstract syntax tree and builds the sympy expression object as it it goes. It is restricted to the operations that ParameterExpression supports and if any part of the string tries to use functionality outside that set it will error.\nDetails and comments\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

To\nsimplify the PR to just the working component this commit removes the\nfile. We can add it back in the future when there is use case for the\nmodule.\n* Change py suffix to prefix\nThis commit just renames the symbol_expr_py file and module to\npy_symbol_expr. We typically use a Py prefix when describing objects\nthat are just for python. This change was just done to make this new\nmodule match that expectation.\n* Fix qiskit-circuit cargo dependencies\nThe Cargo.toml for qiskit-circuit was missing some details to use the\napprox crate correctly with Complex64 types and arrays of those types.\nThis didn't bubble up in combined builds because cargo was reusing the\ncompilation unit for these crates with accelerate which had the correct\nsettings. But when trying to do a standalone build of qiskit-circuit\nthis caused a compilation error. This commit fixes this by updating the\nlocal dependencies to ensure the appropriate features to use approx with\ncomplex and ndarray are set.\n* Use unix style newlines for symbol_parser.rs\n* Remove unused extern crate lines\n* Run cargo fmt\n* add some missing fuction to Python interface\n* fix sqrt\n* add values function to enumerate all values in expression for pi_check.py\n* fix for lint\n* fix for lint error\n* Make conjugate a unary op\nIn testing the conjugate was not working for parameters. This is because\nit was not being treated as a unary op. Values were correctly changing\nthe sign of the complex component, but symbols and expressions would\nnot. To fix this the conjugate was added as a unary op which is tracked\nadded to the expression tree.\n* Add test module for validating all parameter expression ops\nThis commit expands the test coverage for the parameter expression class\nto ensure that we have coverage of all the mathemetical operations that\ncan be performed on an expression and does so with combinations of\noperand types to try and provide more thorough coverage of the class.\nThe only method missing from the tet right now is gradient which can be\nadded later.\n* Add tolerance on new unit tests for multiplication with complex bind\nThis commit adds tolerance to the floating point comparison on the\nmultiplication test with binding a complex number. Running these tests\nin CI was showing failures on different platforms caused by floating\npoint precision differences. This should fix the failures in CI.\n* Fix pow logic for complex numbers\nThe pow logic was overeagerly casting values to complex whenever the lhs of\nthe operation was negative. The output is only complex if the lhs is\nnegative and the rhs has a fractional component. This casting to a\ncomplex was accumulating a small imaginary component because of\nfp precision even though the values shouldn't be complex. This commit\nfixes this issue by adjusting the pow logic to only cast a real or\ninteger value to a complex if it's negative and the rhs has a fractional\ncomponent.\n* Fix more pow impl and expand coverage\n* Remove unused pyfunctions\n* Add more test coverage\n* More test coverage\n* Add tests for .numeric()\n* Add tolerance to test_pow_complex_binding\nThis test was failing in CI on Windows due to differing fp precision.

This commit\nfixes this issue by adjusting the pow logic to only cast a real or\ninteger value to a complex if it's negative and the rhs has a fractional\ncomponent.\n* Fix more pow impl and expand coverage\n* Remove unused pyfunctions\n* Add more test coverage\n* More test coverage\n* Add tests for .numeric()\n* Add tolerance to test_pow_complex_binding\nThis test was failing in CI on Windows due to differing fp precision. To\nfix the failure this adjusts the tests to use assertAlmostEqual instead\nof assertEqual to account for the platform differences.\n* modify SymbolExpr enum structure\n* Fix add/sub optimization\n* Fix PartialOrd for Binary\n* remove Symbol struct, add optimization function and remove on-the-fly optimization\n* add optimization for values, fix equality check\n* remove debug prints\n* reformat for lint test\n* fix cargo error\n* fix for lint\n* fix for lint\n* Fix np.complex128 issue, remove codes for exceptions for np.complex128\n* fix for lint\n* fix for lint\n* Fix symbol_parser.rs, remove BinaryOpContainer, reordering pow operator\n* replace rhs to lhs in __r*__ functions, add multispace0 for unary op parser\n* remove unused imports\n* move replacements of backslashes for sympify into rust\n* fix for lint\n* remove enum for Python multi-types and replace them to PyObject\n* optimize __eq__ when comparing with value\n* remove optimmize() from __hash__\n* rename PySymbolExpr to ParameterExpression and implemented some function so that we can use both from rust and python\n* Fix log and div\n* Expand dedicated ParameterExpression testing\n* Remove unicode charcter to fix windows charmap failure\n* recover value.py as Qiskit#14024\n* lint\n* reflect review comments\n* cargo fmt\n* remove unused imports\n* fix cloning Values\n* format\n* add error handling on parse_expression\n* add exception to is_real when there are unbound parameters\n* Revert \"add exception to is_real when there are unbound parameters\"\nThis reverts commit 1c98127.\n* fix derivative of asin/acos, raise error for sign/conj. Fix sympify with complex numbers\n* restore test_pauli_feature_map, add comment for epsilon\n* format\n* fix for lint\n* remove debug print\n* format\n* Additional tests and gradient note\n- Added a note that the gradient of parameters\n  is only defined for real parameter expressions\n- Added a test to call SparsePauliOp.simplify on\n  with coefficients that have complex multipliers\n- Added numerical checks for derivatives\n* Update crates/circuit/src/parameter_expression.rs\nCo-authored-by: Julien Gacon <gaconju@gmail.com>\n* Update crates/circuit/src/parameter_expression.rs\nCo-authored-by: Julien Gacon <gaconju@gmail.com>\n* Update docs / comments and fix conjugate deriv\n- Update docs: we no longer rely on symengine/sympy for parameters\n- Reword reno: we still install symengine/sympy at this point\n- Fix conjugate derivative: since conj() acts as identity on real numbers, the derivative is 1\n---------\nCo-authored-by: Matthew Treinish <mtreinish@kortar.org>\nCo-authored-by: Julien Gacon <jules.gacon@googlemail.com>\nCo-authored-by: Julien Gacon <gaconju@gmail.com>\n \nSign up for free\nto join this conversation on GitHub.\n    Already have an account?\n    Sign in to comment\n    Reviewers\n  \n \nElePT\nElePT approved these changes\n    Assignees\n  \n \nElePT\n \n    Labels\n  \nChangelog: Bugfix\nInclude in the \"Fixed\" section of the changelog\npriority: high\n    Projects\n  \n    None yet\n \n    Milestone\n  \n \n2.1.0\n    Development\n  \nSuccessfully merging this pull request may close these issues.\n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

         "[\"This pull request (#14024) introduces a custom parser for parameter expression payloads in QPY, replacing the existing `sympy` `parse_expr()` usage, which posed security risks due to reliance on Python's `eval()` function. The new parser utilizes Python's `ast` module to construct `sympy` expressions safely, restricting operations to those supported by `ParameterExpression`. This change enhances security during QPY deserialization and addresses potential vulnerabilities associated with untrusted input. The pull request also includes simplifications in visitor logic and sanity checks to ensure safe operation.\"]",

This is quite common in high-throughput cases, where the circuit is being used as a parametric template for a backend compiler.\nDetails and comments\nSimilar to #13342, this was a couple of very easy tweaks I could make within Python space to slightly improve the runtime performance of the OQ3 importer.  It's still pretty slow for what it does, but there's little point focussing on its performance while it's still pure Python, and the majority of our data models are moving to Rust.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

The modifications target the common case of circuits with numerous singly parametric 1-qubit gates, optimizing runtime for high-throughput applications. While the changes enhance performance, the author notes that the pure Python implementation still limits overall speed, with a future shift towards Rust-based models anticipated.']",

In order to save PrimitiveJob objects locally we need a way to serialize them. It's currently not serializable due to the use of ThreadPoolExecutor:\nqiskit/qiskit/primitives/primitive_job.py\n        Lines 47 to 48\n      in\n      35d0954\n executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=1)  # pylint: disable=consider-using-with \n self._future = executor.submit(self._function, *self._args, **self._kwargs) \nCredit to @t-imamichi\nDetails and comments\nAlso fixes #12787\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

I believe this could be executed on one of the methods, avoiding that function call. You could include the lines here and override one of the reserved methods for serialization: __reduce__, __getstate__, __getnewargs__, depending on your needs.\nNote: This might require you to also implement a __setstate__ method.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

This is because, unlike DAGOpNode, the in and out nodes do not have a name or qargs attribute.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

One can thus compute the causal light cone of the circuit and measurement, i.e. the set of gates that does affect the measurement. This transpiler pass provides an easy tool to reduce the number of gates in our circuit provided a Pauli observable to be measured or  a subset of measurements in the Z basis.\nThis PR adresses  #12792\nDetails and comments\nThis code takes inspiration from an implementation done by @aeddins-ibm.\nBefore finishing the unit-tests for this PR it would be interesting to solve #12790 .\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

A one circuit in, many circuits out, is not currently supported in the transpiler interface.

That would e.g. allow to decompose a larger observable into smaller (e.g. ZZZ... into Z0, Z1, ...) -- this would give a larger light cone since now things might not commute which would in the bigger observable, but it would make the commutation check faster (which I think would use a matrix multiplication check for non-standard gates).\nBut that's probably not required for the beginning and we could just issue a warning if the commutation check becomes problematic 🙂\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

This is linked to #13828. How should we proceed? Do we wait until the issue is fixed for merging this PR, or should we just throw a warning for now if the Pauli string gets too big?\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

         "['The Light Cone Transpiler Pass has been implemented to optimize quantum circuits by determining the causal light cone, allowing for the removal of gates that do not impact measurement outcomes. This PR addresses issue #12792 and enhances the efficiency of circuit transpilation. It provides a tool to simplify circuits based on a specified Pauli observable or a subset of Z basis measurements. The implementation includes a focus on unit tests and acknowledges the need to resolve issue #12790 before finalizing tests.']",

         "[\"This pull request, titled 'Do not retain and expose old elements of ParameterVector', resolves issue #12541 as per the review in #12545. It modifies the handling of `ParameterVector` to prevent the retention and exposure of outdated elements, particularly during deserialization processes. This change is relevant to the core of the `QuantumCircuit` class, and while no new features are introduced, it ensures better management of parameters. A test was also fixed in the process.\"]",

Right now in Qiskit the only valid Backend subclass is BackendV2 so this other code path is never executable. This commit simplifies this method so that only the BackendV2 code path exists. However, the signature is not changed for backwards compatibility, which is something we'll need to manage if/when a BackendV3 is added.\nDetails and comments\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

The `.from_duration()` method has been updated so that it only handles the BackendV2 case, thereby cleaning up the codebase. The method signature remains unchanged to ensure backward compatibility as the project may expand to include a BackendV3 in the future. This change contributes to better code maintenance and clarity.']",

Could I please see the depth table for MCX? I have a feeling that's why mine is different.\nAlthough, I just upgraded my qiskit to latest version, and it gives the exact same depth as I do.\nfrom qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile\nqc = QuantumCircuit(10)\nqc.mcx(list(range(9)), 9)\nqc = transpile(qc, basis_gates=['cx', 'u3'])\nqc.depth()\n>>> 703\nwhich becomes 705 when sandwiched between sdg and s.\nOHH.

Please reload this page.\n \n \n \nSummary\nThis rewrites the symbol handling of the OpenQASM 3 exporter to decouple object identities from the necessary object identifiers.  As part of this, we use the same trick of standard-gate reparametrisation to produce gate-definition sources for Qiskit built-ins, which fixes many cases of bad parametrisation of gates like rzx.\nThis kind of rewrite was necessary to fix the now-bad assumption within the OQ3 exporter that \"gate identity\" is always static within a circuit. Since standard gate Gate instances are now only generated on demand, there is no guarantee of stability of them.  The fix to the definition source for these makes them independent of object identity. User-defined gates can still use the identity, as these are still guaranteed static.\nThis commit fixes almost all of the \"bad parametrisation\" tests in the test suite.  There are several other changes in the test suite necessary:\nsince the uniqueness of the identifier is now independent of how the lookup of a Qiskit object works, there is no need to include the highly non-deterministic id in the generated symbols for user gates. Several tests changed to use the new, simple count-based unique names.\nthe escaping and uniqueness rules now apply uniformly to all gate definitions, fixing several bad test cases that previously were testing invalid OpenQASM 3.\nthe escaping rules changed slightly for naming collisions with keywords, making them slightly more consistent with how other renaming rules worked.\nDetails and comments\nThis unblocks #12730 by fixing the broken assumption about object identity for standard gates.\nFix Some internal polishing is needed in the QASM3 exporter #7136 (not to say it's perfect now, but this addresses all the problems tracked by that issue).\nFix QASM 2 and 3 exporters do not handle parameterised gates correctly #7335\nFix QASM 3 exporter makes multiple definitions for same gate #9428\nFix qasm3 returns wrong results with pauli evolution gate #11954\nFix Basis gate set with RXX gate converted with QASM3 and run with Aer simulator results in 'unknown instruction: rxx_139974866104288' #11560\nFix  Qiskit’s OpenQASM 3 exporter: not correctly escaping the names of custom gates it’s defining #11761\nSupersede Make fewer accesses, instruction.operation, in exporter.py #12481\nThis fixes the underlying bug that PR 12481 was attempting to address, though reducing the use of instruction.operation as that PR does could still be a benefit to performance.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

I suppose you'd have attach a type or other label to each object, in order to do this. But I don't see a lot of types otherwise.

The fix to the definition\nsource for these makes them independent of object identity.\nUser-defined gates can still use the identity, as these are still\nguaranteed static.\nThis commit fixes almost all of the \"bad parametrisation\" tests in the\ntest suite.

We can't actually do that, though, because the prior call to assign_parameters erases the original parametric definition, so we can't find it again.  The test as written doesn't use p0 or p1.\nWith this PR, this \"bad\" behaviour is only limited to custom user gates, though, so it's not such a huge deal anymore, as it's rather less likely to come up in practice.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

         "['This pull request rewrites the symbol handling of the OpenQASM 3 exporter to decouple object identities from necessary object identifiers. It addresses several issues, including fixing bad parameterization of gates like `rzx`, and ensures that gate definitions are now independent of object identity. The changes resolve multiple bugs related to parameterized gates and improve the escaping and uniqueness rules for gate definitions. This PR fixes many \"bad parameterization\" tests and enhances overall functionality, while also unblocking issue #12730.']",

It might look like a lot of changes but I mostly moved around existing code (the one you already reviewed). As a summary:\nI restructured the Rust file to try to make it more understandable and reduce code repetition, I also added comments.\nOn the Python side, I moved the DefaultUnitarySynthesis plugin code to an independent file. This plugin duplicates the Rust logic, which unfortunately was developed in parallel to the plugin infrastructure. The Rust code combines the pass run_main_loop logic with the plugin run and currently cannot simply replace the plugin run. Ideally, we could yet again refactor the code to match the plugin infrastructure, but I don't think this will be possible before 2.0 (in terms of time).\nFor reference, the Python DefaultUnitarySynthesis class is still set as a fallback for the case where a custom plugin fails, which is the reason why I haven't removed it either. At least separating it from UnitarySynthesis might explain a bit better the situation.\n 👍\n1\n ShellyGarion reacted with thumbs up emoji\n \nAll reactions\n👍\n1 reaction\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

I might be missing something even more basis here, doesn't UnitarySynthesis pass by default call the DefaultSynthesisPlugin?\nAnd special thanks adding code comments, this helped me a lot to understand what each different function does.\nI am approving it, but I think there were also some review comments from @ShellyGarion.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

To answer your question, the code shouldn't be duplicated. The reason why it is is that at the time the unitary synthesis code was originally oxidized, we didn't have any reference of how to interact with the plugin infrastructure, and because we only had 1 unitary synthesis plugin (the infrastructure wasn't really taken advantage of), we went for the path of replicating the whole flow in rust. In hindsight it would be way more modular to have only the plugin run method in rust, but implementing this now requires a refactoring that I didn't have the time to prioritize yet. Once you finish the HLS oxidization it might also be a good idea to try to make unitary synthesis is pluggable in the HLS workflow. This is something I briefly discussed with @Cryoris. The TL:DR is: not enough information at the time, not enough time to fix it when the information was clear.\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

Previously the function could be called with fewer qubits available and the synthesized quantum circuit was not guaranteed to fit into the original quantum circuit leading to internal errors in HighLevelSynthesis pass.\nThird, it adds the default synthesis plugin for FullAdderGate and improves the default synthesis plugins for HalfAdderGate and ModularAdderGate to always choose the best synthesis method depending on the number of ancillas available. Previously, we were getting less optimal circuits for certain small values of n.\nDetails and comments\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

         "['This PR (Pull Request #13530) implements minor fixes and enhancements for the adder and multiplier gate classes (FullAdderGate, HalfAdderGate, ModularAdderGate, and MultiplierGate) in Qiskit. Key changes include the addition of the _define method to allow construction of Operators from circuits with these gates, fixes to plugins for adder gates ensuring proper use of ancilla qubits, and improvements to synthesis methods for optimal circuit generation. The PR also includes added tests for scenarios where adder plugins do not apply. Overall, these changes enhance the functionality and performance of quantum circuits using these gates.']",

It will also call SparseObservable.simplify for every observable.\n The methods __array__, __getitem__, and tolist will return mappings, as today.\n __repr__ will return the same string as it does now.\nDetails and comments\nOther items of ObservablesArray to be based on SparseObservable #14129 will be done in subsequent or parallel PRs, I'm trying to maximize the number of PRs.\nCurrently WIP - the first commit only performs modifications to tests, without yet writing new tests and without implementation.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

I don't understand the reason for the switch either, because one still has __array__ and can do np.array(obs_array[...]) to get the actual matrix.\nFor example,\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3]\nmy_list[::2] # returns list\nmy_list[0] # returns int\nmy_array = np.linspace(0, 1, 100)\nmy_array[::2] # returns np.ndarray\nmy_array[0] # returns np.float64\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

         "['This PR (#14132) aims to replace the internal representation of `ObservablesArray` with `SparseObservable`. Key modifications include updating the `coerce_observable` method to ensure all entries in `ObservablesArrayLike._array` are of type `SparseObservable` and calling `SparseObservable.simplify` for each observable. The methods `__array__`, `__getitem__`, and `tolist` will continue to return mappings, while `__repr__` will maintain its current string output. The PR is currently a work in progress, with initial changes focusing on modifying tests without implementing new features yet. Ongoing discussions suggest considerations around backward compatibility and functionality impacts.']",

Key changes include updated settings that cater to a broader range of graph classes and the removal of graph attributes when specific conditions are met. The PR comprises 12 commits and aims to ensure better visual clarity and representation in quantum circuit graph layouts.']",

Please reload this page.\n \n \n \nThese changes were needed to get the qiskit-experiments tests to pass in this PR that moves all circuit execution from Backend.run to SamplerV2.run, making use of BackendSamplerV2 as the translation layer. We can add a release note and a test if needed but I wanted to see if these changes would be acceptable or not first. There are a couple other related issues/questions I had:\nRight now, BackendSamplerV2 accepts an options dict and unpacks it into its Options class. These options are then passed through to Backend.run (except shots that is passed through only if it not overridden). This mechanism means that support for any additional arguments also requires changing the Options class again. Could all the options just be passed through besides shots?\nSecondary request to the previous one -- I can see why keeping to the Options format is more standard so it might not be acceptable to accept and pass through all options. If so, could we change the __init__ to filter the keys in options and only pass the ones through to Options that have defined fields and warn about the ones that do not? This would make it a little easier to add new options in the future without breaking support for previous versions of Qiskit since an option not in the older Options definition will cause Options(**options) to fail and Options being a non-public class it is not supported to peak at its fields and filter before passing the options (edit: one could create a dummy BackendSamplerV2 and check its options fields and use them to filter the options for the real BackendSamplerV2 without accessing a private class).\nCaveat to the previous points -- maybe we won't need to add support for any more backend run options.\nFor the qiskit-experiments tests, I also needed to delete this line:\nqiskit/qiskit/primitives/backend_estimator.py\n         Line 63\n      in\n      9a1d8d3\n circ.metadata = {} \nIs there any way to work around that issue? Can we revisit if the metadata still needs to be blanked out like that or could we pass through some kind of keep_metadata option? The qiskit-experiments test backends use the metadata to determine what results to return for the circuits. We can look into how to refactor the experiments tests to get the metadata a different way if not.\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

Pydot 3 stores them in declaration order.

I guess the open question is did you want to throw a test version constraint on > 3.0.0 and leave the optional requirement at whatever the current minimum is? It doesn't matter too much so feel free to just enqueue this for merging if you're fine leaving the minimum for testing unchanged.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

Updating the handling of text fields (like labels) that now require values to be enclosed in quotes if they contain special characters.\\n\\nWhile the tests are updated to reflect the new behavior of pydot 3.0, Qiskit remains compatible with pydot 2 for general usage.']",

The Var type was not handled in the attribute callback functions for nodes and edges. This was causing the visualizer to fail if the dag contained these types.

I'm not a big fan of image diff tests, and in this case will be very tricky for me to write because I have a newer version of graphviz installed locally and none of the existing graphviz based visualization tests pass locally.\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

         "['This pull request (#12848) addresses a bug in the DAG visualization for Qiskit that affected the handling of classical variable types (Var). The issue arose because the Var type was not properly managed in the attribute callback functions for nodes and edges, leading to visualization failures when these types were present in the DAG. The fix includes explicit handling for Var types and utilizes the name attribute of the Var object to ensure proper visualization. Additionally, release notes and a test have been added to accompany this improvement.']",

Additionally this fixes an issue where other ops would not appear properly in layers that contained BoxOps. With this PR, a box containing noops disappears since it has a 0 width. If that's an issue, we can create a special case for empty boxes and widen the outside box and include an empty box inside.\nqc = QuantumCircuit(5)\nqc.x(0)\nwith qc.box():\n    qc.x(0)\nwith qc.box():\n    qc.x(0, label=\"xxxxii\")\n    qc.x(0, label=\"xxxxii\")\nqc.x(0)\nwith qc.box():\n    qc.cx(2, 3)\n    with qc.box():\n        qc.noop(4)\nqc.x(2)\nqc.draw(\"mpl\", scale=0.7, style={\"showindex\": True})\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

         "[\"This pull request (PR #14529) improves the BoxOps in Qiskit's visualization by reducing the space inside the boxes and fixing layering issues with other operations. Specifically, it addresses an empty space on the left side of the BoxOps and ensures that operations appear correctly when layered with BoxOps. The changes include 33 commits, with modifications to box sizing and layering logic. This PR resolves issue #14506 and enhances the clarity and functionality of quantum circuit diagrams.\"]",

During the oxidization efforts, unitary_synthesis._decomposer_2q_from_basis_gates was replaced with inline code that didn't contemplate this path (always set a default decomposer), which in the reproducing example led to a longer output circuit (the gates were collected into a unitary block and then decomposed differently).\nDetails and comments\nTechnically not a bugfix because the change wasn't released yet.\nUsing the example shown in the issue ->\nConsolidateBlocks output dag with 1.2.4:\nConsolidateBlocks output dag with 1.3.0rc1:\nConsolidateBlocks output dag after this fix:\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

I remember changing that logic at the time and thinking it wouldn't impact anything. I was coming at it from the mindset that consolidate blocks is too likely to skip consolidation when it shouldn't.\nRealistically we should be relying on the xx decomposer with the rzz in the basis gates list, but there isn't an interface in rust yet to tell us the estimated number of 2q basis gates needed for a unitary, which is why I changed the logic here. Also that is not really a good meteic anyway, just more reason for me to keep working on #13419 and introduce a better approach.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

(because I just re-added it)\nassuming that we don't want to use the XXDecomposer for rzx. What do we want to have then, None or TwoQubitBasisDecomposer(CXGate())?

ConsolidateBlocks tries to guess how many 2q gates will be used to decide whether to consolidate the block into a unitary or not. This is strongly coupled to the behavior of UnitarySynthesis because that's what actually does the synthesis later. But none of this actually takes into account multiple possible decomposers/synthesis methods being supported by a target, or the presence of a non-default plugin being used.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

This might result in some blocks not getting consolidated which were before, but in practice I find it probably pretty unlikely since it only counts rzz gates when evaluating if the block's gates are more than the expected synthesis output.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

Now:\nThe default decomposer is None when no basis_gates/kak_gates are found (same as OG). This includes the rzz gate from the issue [EDIT: didn't work. Reverted that change]\nIf an rxx gate is found, the decomposer will be  the TwoQubitBasisDecomposer with a RXX(pi/2) (same as OG)\nIf an rzx gate is found, the decomposer will be the TwoQubitBasisDecomposer with a CXGate (same as backup decomposer from OG implementation)\nI also added a comment that mentions the previous use of the XXDecomposer for the rzx case for clarity.\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

There might be some subtle differences in what gets consolidated or not with rzx based on differences between XXDecomposer.num_basis_gates and TwoQubitBasisDecomposer's logic, but it should be close enough to the 1.2.x state of the logic that I'm not worried.\nI think this whole exercise reinforces for me how we need to improve the logic around block consolidation. #13419 will do this for the optimization loop, but we will need to think what makes the most sense for when we run ConsolidateBlocks prior to layout in the init stage.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

         "[\"This pull request (#13450) fixes a behavioral change in the `ConsolidateBlocks` component that was introduced in a prior merge (#13368). The implementation restores the original behavior by setting the decomposer to None when kak_gates are not found. Additionally, it adds a test to reproduce the issue and re-adds the 'rzz' gate to the list of supported gates. The changes ensure that the output circuit maintains its expected structure and performance.\"]",

Also added a smaller test which does non-trivial swapping (with swap gates removed using the elide permutation pass) before the unitary test which surfaced a possible bug in the layout composition phase.

Note that just using count_ops is tricky since we have a unitary both before (as the 2-qubit unitary) and after (as two individual 1-qubit unitaries).

I just have a few small comments and questions inline. The biggest one I think is over how/when you're thinking we should integrate this new feature into the preset pass managers.

         "['This PR updates the `Split2QUnitaries` transpiler pass to accommodate SWAP unitary gates, allowing two-qubit unitaries to be decomposed into a SWAP gate and one-qubit gates. It introduces a new processing step that dynamically alters the qubit layout when SWAP gates are detected, optimizing the quantum circuit representation. The changes aim to improve circuit transpilation efficiency and address issue #13476. Additionally, tests have been added to ensure the functionality works as intended. The PR has been reviewed and successfully merged.']",

I mostly had comments about our pickle handling through these cases - I think there's a fair amount of places where we could entirely elide the __getstate__ and __setstate__ calls and do it all through __getnewargs__ (and some places where we're duplicating things already).\nThe other super minor point is whether you think it's worth deferring to Python-space formatting in __repr__ methods.  It's not as fast, but if anything is bottlenecked on __repr__ we should probably make sure it isn't, and using the Python-space formatting means everything will be consistent no matter how deep or shallow in the object hierarchy a __repr__ is called.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

         "['This PR (#12380) ports the `DAGNode` class and its subclasses to Rust, laying the groundwork for efficient implementations of `DAGCircuit` methods. The changes include the addition of 355 lines and the removal of 174 lines across 10 commits. Notably, the `semantic_eq` function was not ported due to dependencies on Python interpreter components. Additionally, unnecessary state methods related to CircuitInstruction pickling have been removed. This work aims to reduce interpreter interaction and improve performance within the Qiskit framework.']",

At the time of this commit it was before the majority of the transpiler infrastructure was ported to rust. At that time the pass was ported we had a few one off passes that were ported to rust and we had to manage the Python rust boundary carefully. The pattern was typically to define custom rust data types that provided an alternate view of the DAGCircuit and the target for compilation that was built out of the Python space dag and target. The star prerouting pass was ported to Rust and leveraged the existing infrastructure used by SabreSwap and SabreLayout as the function of the pass on a DAG was very similar to Sabre (finding where to insert swaps and rebuilding the dag where swaps are needed). At the time this was a pragmatic choice to accelerate the pass and not need to wait for the needed infrastructure to be written in Rust. However in practice the performance gains the Rust porting of the algorithm provided were not as large as was originally hoped and now the code of the pass is tied directly to the current implementation of sabre. As the sabre interface layer is being re-written in #14317 this is proving to be a blocker for that effort. This commit reverts the current rust implementation to unblock the sabre refactoring effort.\nIt's still definitely worth porting this pass to Rust but we now have sufficient infrastructure in Rust to write full transpiler passes without Python. We should follow up this PR and rewrite the star prerouting pass so that full pass operates completely in rust and directly leverages the native data structures that exist in Rust now instead of the hybrid approach that ties the is tightly coupled to the internals of the sabre pass.\nDetails and comments\nThis reverts commit b23c545.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

         "[\"This pull request reverts the previous attempt to port the star prerouting pass to Rust due to inadequate performance gains and complications arising from its integration with the Sabre interface. The original Rust implementation was a temporary measure that has since become a blocker for necessary refactoring efforts within the Sabre layer. The author notes that sufficient Rust infrastructure is now available, enabling a more effective future rewrite of the star prerouting pass that will fully utilize Rust's capabilities without reliance on Python. This change aims to unblock ongoing development and improve the overall structure of the transpiler.\", 'This PR reverts the prior attempt to port the `star_preroute` pass to Rust due to suboptimal performance gains and complications with the Sabre interface integration.

At the time of this commit it was before the majority of the transpiler infrastructure was ported to rust. At that time the pass was ported we had a few one off passes that were ported to rust and we had to manage the Python rust boundary carefully. The pattern was typically to define custom rust data types that provided an alternate view of the DAGCircuit and the target for compilation that was built out of the Python space dag and target. The star prerouting pass was ported to Rust and leveraged the existing infrastructure used by SabreSwap and SabreLayout as the function of the pass on a DAG was very similar to Sabre (finding where to insert swaps and rebuilding the dag where swaps are needed). At the time this was a pragmatic choice to accelerate the pass and not need to wait for the needed infrastructure to be written in Rust. However in practice the performance gains the Rust porting of the algorithm provided were not as large as was originally hoped and now the code of the pass is tied directly to the current implementation of sabre. As the sabre interface layer is being re-written in #14317 this is proving to be a blocker for that effort. This commit reverts the current rust implementation to unblock the sabre refactoring effort.\nIt's still definitely worth porting this pass to Rust but we now have sufficient infrastructure in Rust to write full transpiler passes without Python. We should follow up this PR and rewrite the star prerouting pass so that full pass operates completely in rust and directly leverages the native data structures that exist in Rust now instead of the hybrid approach that ties the is tightly coupled to the internals of the sabre pass.\nDetails and comments\nThis reverts commit b23c545.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

This PR removes this line of code, and lets numpy handle the broadcasting of phase.\nThis PR also adds a check in PauliList.from_symplectic(..., phase) to reject phase if it is a multi-dimensional array, and a test for issue #13623.\n(For the record, I messed up the commit message in 92161ec. The simpler if/elif case is indeed moved to be first, but in the commit message I mixed up the two cases).\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

But, this happens automatically and correctly if we just add as-is. So this commit simplifies the code accordingly.\n \n \n \nVerify that phase is 1D in from_symplectic()\n    …\n \n49da9ce\nVerifying the input arg `phase`, since otherwise `from_symplectic()` will silently create PauliLists with malformed `phase` attributes (i.e. not 1D).\nZero-dimensional is OK (e.g. `phase` defaults to `0`) since that can broadcast per the shape of the `z` and `x` arrays.\n \n \n \nremove vestigial line\necaed3c\n \n \n \nlint\n4cb2c5f\n \n \naeddins-ibm\n          requested a review\n  from a team\n    as a code owner\nJanuary 8, 2025 06:16\nqiskit-bot\n          added\n  the \n  Community PR\nPRs from contributors that are not 'members' of the Qiskit repo\n label\n      Jan 8, 2025\n \n      \n            Copy link\n \n \nCollaborator\nqiskit-bot\n      \n      commented\n        Jan 8, 2025\nThank you for opening a new pull request.\nBefore your PR can be merged it will first need to pass continuous integration tests and be reviewed.

         "['This pull request (PR #13624) fixes a bug in the `PauliList.insert(..., qubit=True)` method for length-1 `pauli_list`, which incorrectly set the phase attribute as a 2D array instead of 1D. The change simplifies phase broadcasting by removing a problematic line of code, allowing NumPy to handle the broadcasting correctly. It also adds a validation check in `PauliList.from_symplectic(...)` to reject multi-dimensional phase inputs and includes a test for issue #13623.']",

From profiling there is still significant overhead in substitute_node_with_dag() that gets called a lot by the basis translator. While I could work on mitigating that I think between #12730 and then eventually #12550 will just take care of that. So if we need to do something for 1.2 there we can handle it in a follow up.\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

Please reload this page.\n \n \n \nSummary\nThis PR fixes a number of bugs we have recently discovered in the Python code for the Solovay-Kitaev decomposition, together with @Cryoris and @anedumla.\nFixes include:\nfixed a problem with the rotation axis computation for 180 degree rotations (thanks to @Cryoris for working out the math)\nfixed a problem where the global phase of the returned circuit might have been off by $\\pi$, due to the underlying algorithm approximating not the original SU(2) matrix, but its projection onto SO(3)\nin particular fixed Global phase on Solovay-Kitaev decomposition seems wrong #9552.\nLonger-term, we will deprecate the Python code for Solovay-Kitaev decomposition altogether, and switch to the new improved pass written in Rust that also fixes these problems (see #14203), however for backward compatibility we need to temporarily support the Python code as well, and thus it makes sense to fix the problems on the Python side too.\nDetails and comments\nOther changes:\nThere was a very strange \"back door\" for returning a circuit with the original unitary matrix if the computed matrix is not close to the identity. This behavior is not consistent with the documented description of the pass and was removed. (Or rather the functions to_circuit and to_dag remain for backwards compatibility but are no longer used by the main pass).\nThe GateSequence class used to store both the SO(3) matrix as product and the SU(2) matrix as product_su2, however the parameter product_su2 was not updated correctly in various places (and it was not even clear what to do within GateSequence.from_matrix). As product_su2 was almost not used anywhere in the algorithm (with the exception of one place where its usage did not seem to be correct anyway), it was simply removed to avoid confusion and unnecessary computations.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

This fixes the global phase of the\ncomputed approximation.\nIn addition, the product_su2 matrix in GateSequence was not correctly computed in many cases,\nleading to incorrect values when using this attribute. Since this is not needed for the actual\nalgorithm (and spends unnecessary effort for computing it), this also completely removes this\nattribute.\nCo-authored-by: Almudena Carrera Vazquez <almudenacarreravazquez@hotmail.com>\n \n \n \nFix the tests.\n    …\n \n13103ed\nOne of the tests was simply wrong because the reference circuit has the wrong global phase.\nThe tests that check the gates in the final decomposition should not assume that SGate is included and SdgGate is not.\n \n \nalexanderivrii\n          requested a review\n  from a team\n    as a code owner\nApril 17, 2025 11:26\n \n      \n            Copy link\n \n \nCollaborator\nqiskit-bot\n      \n      commented\n        Apr 17, 2025\nOne or more of the following people are relevant to this code:\n@Qiskit/terra-core\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

Please reload this page.\n \n \n \nOne more problem that I have recently discovered (and fixed in the followup PR #14225) is that the SolovayKitaevSynthesis unitary synthesis plugin caches the computed approximations regardless of the basis set, that is the following code:\ncircuit = QuantumCircuit(1)\ncircuit.rx(0.8, 0)\nunitary = Operator(circuit).data\nplugin = SolovayKitaevSynthesis()\n# First, use the [\"h\", \"t\", \"tdg\"] set\nout = plugin.run(unitary, basis_gates=[\"h\", \"t\", \"tdg\"])\nprint(out.count_ops())\nself.assertLessEqual(set(out.count_ops().keys()), {\"h\", \"t\", \"tdg\"})\n# Second, use the [\"h\", \"s\"] set\nout = plugin.run(unitary, basis_gates=[\"h\", \"s\", \"sdg\"])\nself.assertLessEqual(set(out.count_ops().keys()), {\"h\", \"s\", \"sdg\"})\nprint(out.count_ops())\nsynthesizes both times to the first specified basis set of [\"h\", \"t\", \"tdg\"]. Creating two different SolovayKitaevSynthesis() plugins does not solve this, since the caching is done at a class-level attribute. The fix (many thanks to @eliarbel for the suggestion!) consists of storing a dictionary from the basis sets to cached approximations instead. I am wondering if it would make sense to include this fix in this PR instead?\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

Indeed, in the discussed S/H-case we just get back the empty circuit, which is the correct answer (for some reason I thought that this is not what would happen). I don't think anymore that the main run method of Solovay-Kitaev can return a circuit with a unitary gate, so this change does not even matter.\nFor the record: I do think that it would be best to simplify the arguments to different functions (those that need to take matrices should take matrices and not gate sequences), however I agree with you that there is no point to work on this in the Python space, as we are in the process of replacing this code by a much better Rust version.\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

         "[\"This pull request (PR #14217) addresses several bugs in the Solovay-Kitaev decomposition implementation in Qiskit. Key fixes include:\\n\\n- Correction of the rotation axis computation for 180-degree rotations.\\n- Resolution of a global phase issue where the circuit's phase was off by π, impacting the accuracy of the algorithm.\\n- Removal of an unnecessary attribute in the GateSequence class that caused confusion.\\n- Updates to tests to reflect the correct global phase and ensure proper functionality.\\n\\nThe PR also notes the intention to deprecate the Python implementation in favor of a more efficient Rust version while maintaining support for the existing code during the transition for backward compatibility.\"]",

It relies on the internal implementation detail about how the to_undirected method works in rustworkx (internally iterates over the edges in id order).

Which would work (and actually would be slightly faster) but would depend on the internal behavior. What you have here is more robust and a better approach.\n 👍\n1\n kevinsung reacted with thumbs up emoji\n \nAll reactions\n👍\n1 reaction\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

This should work like TwoLocal does.\nDetails and comments\nBecause both ZFeatureMap and ZZFeatureMap inherits from the PauliFeatureMap the problem was with how PauliFeatureMap handles the entanglement lists.  To generate proper entanglement layers PauliFeatureMap relies on the get_entangler_map() (the method which takes 3 arguments) method from NLocal which handles invalid inputs and generates properly formatted entanglement layers. But unlike TwoLocal where we specify rotation blocks and the entanglement blocks as separate arguments, for PauliFeatureMap the paulis are specified as a single list. Due to this, we need some additional logic to handle how entanglement layers are generated from the user specified entanglement list.\nTo fix this I have added a helper method _selective_entangler_map() and also added get_entangler_map() method to PauliFeatureMap. The newly specified get_entangler_map() method will override the get_entangler_map() method from the NLocal class for List[List(int)] or List[List[List[int]]] or List[List[List[List[int]]]] but if any other input is passed to entanglement (like a str full) then we fall back on the method from NLocal to handle those cases.\nWith my fix all the below examples work as expected:\nIf entanglement is a List[List(int)]:\nN = 5\nlayer1 = (0,1)\nlayer2 = (1,0)\nqc = PauliFeatureMap(N, reps=2, paulis=['Z', 'ZZ'], entanglement=[layer1, layer3], insert_barriers=True)\nqc.decompose().draw('mpl')\nIf entanglement is a List[List[List[int]]] (This means that entanglement will change according to reps):\nN = 5\nlayer1 = [(0,1,2)]\nlayer2 = [(3,2,1)]\nqc = PauliFeatureMap(N, reps=3, paulis=['Z', 'ZZZ'], entanglement=[layer1, layer2], insert_barriers=True)\nqc.decompose().draw('mpl', fold=-1)\nIf entanglement is List[List[List[List[int]]]] (This means that entanglement will change according to reps and paulis):\nN = 5\nlayers = [[[(0,1), (2,3)], [(1,2), (3,4)]], [[(1,0), (3,2)] , [(2,1), (4,3)]]]\nqc = PauliFeatureMap(N, reps=3, paulis=['Z', 'ZZ', 'XX'], entanglement=layers, insert_barriers=True)\nqc.decompose().draw('mpl')\n@nonhermitian please review this and let me know if I should make any further changes.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

This is indeed a missing feature or wrong documentation. However, I'm not sure this is the right approach to solving it, as this selection might get very messy if you have Pauli connections with differing numbers of qubits.\nIs there a use-case for which you need specific entanglements? If yes, another approach could be to support a dictionary with {num_qubits: entanglement} pairs, e.g.\nentanglement = {\n    1: [(0,), (2,)],\n    2: [(0, 1), (1, 2)],\n    3: [(0, 1, 2)]\n}\nzz_feature_map = ZZFeatureMap(.., paulis=[\"z\", \"zz\", \"zzz\"], entanglement=entanglement)\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

This gives more flexibility in creating custom feature maps.\nCurrently, classes like TwoLocal, NLocal, and others that handle encoding allow entanglement to be specified using various formats like List[List[int]], List[List[List[int]]], or List[List[List[List[int]]]].

However, if you believe that using a dictionary wouldn’t cause any issues, I would be happy to implement this approach.\nIt's good to think about this -- in this case I would say it is fine to have the subclass have a specific behavior, since it does have a special structure and the list[list[list... does not apply here.\nAlso, I might be misunderstanding your concern, but I’m unclear on what you meant by:\nas this selection might get very messy if you have Pauli connections with differing numbers of qubits.\nThe current implementation works even when the entanglement is layer1 = [(0,), (2,), (1,2), (0,1,2)]\nI mean that the entanglement list can (1) get very large if we have all layers in one list, and (2) it can get difficult to read as one could even accidentially mix the layers, such as [(0,1), (1,2), (2,3), (1,2,3), (3,4), (0,1,2), (0,),...].\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

I'll also add few tests and releasenotes for these changes.\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

I think it would be better if the code is as explicit as possible, instead of adding entanglement that is not specified.

         "['This pull request (PR #12767) fixes the `ZZFeatureMap` class in Qiskit, enabling it to accept complex entanglement structures such as `List[List[int]]`, `List[List[List[int]]]`, and `List[List[List[List[int]]]]`, which previously caused errors. The fix introduces a helper method, `_selective_entangler_map()`, and an overridden `get_entangler_map()` method to correctly generate entanglement layers. This aligns `ZZFeatureMap` with the behavior of `TwoLocal`. The PR also updates typing hints, adds tests, and modifies documentation to reflect these changes. Overall, this increases the flexibility of feature map configurations in Qiskit.']",

         "['This pull request (#13214) merges five commits that enhance the CollectCliffords transpiler pass in Qiskit. The key change is the addition of a `matrix_based` argument, allowing the collection of Rz(pi/2) and other unitary Clifford gates. This improvement stems from suggestions made in prior discussions and aims to optimize quantum circuit transpilation. The update includes necessary tests to validate the new functionality and is classified as a new feature in the changelog.']",

It ensures that neighboring sequences are mutually orthogonal (to avoid collisions, like in staggered DD) but also whether the qubit is a CX or ECR target/control spectator. This is nicely summarized in a figure of the paper, where the different wire colors denote different decoupling sequences:\nThis particularly leads to improvement if a lot of qubits are idle at the same time or if they are next to ECR/CX gates. One important category of circuits in this class are the layers in twirled circuits. This pass also works best if the ECR/CX gate times are the same for all connections, which is almost always the case on IBM devices.\nSome simple experiments show that this pass performs better than the current standard in Qiskit, PadDynamicaDecoupling with an X-X sequence. Here's some basic benchmarks, see the paper for more:\nThis code is based off @kdk and @ajavadia 🙂\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

I suggest getting input from Kevin or Ali if you want another pair of eyes on this aspect.\nI've left line comments, most of which are minor but still require addressing.\nIn terms of performence - do you have a sense about the overhead of the block collection and manipulation (e.g. _collect_adjacenet_delay_blocks )?\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

The new default is therefore that we only add DD sequences for idle times beyond 2 * (max_2q_duration - min_2q_duration). This needs some benchmarking on real devices before merging.\nHi @Cryoris are you planning to benchmark the new min_joinable_duration default on real devices before the 2.1 release?\n 👀\n1\n Cryoris reacted with eyes emoji\n \nAll reactions\n👀\n1 reaction\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

But the results of CA-DD look promising on the eagle devices and the overhead can be controlled with the min_joinable_duration parameter.\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

I haven't reviewed the algorithm in depth against the paper, but I ran several examples and the results look OK. Still, I'd like to look into some of the algorithmic aspects a bit more. In the meantime, I have a couple questions and possible suggestions, both not major:\nThe rationale behind the default value for min_joinable_duration is not so clear to me. Also, it doesn't feel very intuitive as a knob for controlling the amount of DD inserted into the circuit. Is there some underlying intuition behind the choice, something that could be added to the docstring to help clarify this a bit?\n'cz' is included in the calculation of the 2q gate length variance in _gate_length_variance. However, the logic for handling spectator qubits does not account for CZGates. Was this intentional, perhaps due to the differences in crosstalk levels between Heron and Eagle devices? If so, this introduces a technology assumption in the implementation, isn't it? I'm wondering if it would make sense to provide a way for users to opt in or out of spectator qubit analysis for specific gate types?\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

It's a knob that lets you trade-off between potentially many short sequences or longer blocks. The default value is picked to ensure that a layer of CX/ECR will not have a lot of short DD sequences just due to the difference in duration. But this is not discussed in the paper afaik and I'm happy to change this if you think there's a more reasonable choice 🙂\nRe: CZ -- The paper only investigates CX/ECR. CZ would probably require a different spectator qubit handling, but this is not explained in the paper and hence not supported in the code. We can add an argument that allows to turn off the spectator-specific logic for CX/ECR.\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

But this is not discussed in the paper afaik and I'm happy to change this if you think there's a more reasonable choice 🙂\nThe reason I treated this is as a knob to control the amount of DD is because of this check:\nif (\n    node.op.name == \"delay\"\n    and not is_after_reset(node)\n    and self._duration(node, qubit_map) > self._min_joinable_duration\n   )\nin _get_sorted_delays.  It skips durations shorter than min_joinable_duration when collecting eligible delays, effectively becoming a filter of idle blocks based on their lengths. This is because shorter delays are not just omitted from adjacency blocks and have their own DD sequences, they are skipped altogether. If we want a truly min_joinable_duration behavior in the \"joinable\" sense, we'll probably want to handle the parameter in _collect_adjacent_delay_blocks.  As for the value default value itself, I see the reasoning for layers so I think it's OK. But now I think that a name that better reflects how the logic is implemented currently is min_duration 😄\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

         "['The pull request #12825, titled \"Context-aware dynamical decoupling,\" introduces a new feature to the Qiskit framework aimed at optimizing quantum circuit performance. The context-aware dynamical decoupling method takes into account the activities of neighboring qubits when selecting decoupling sequences, ensuring mutual orthogonality and addressing specific qubit roles (target/control/spectator). This approach leads to improved performance, particularly in circuits with many idle qubits or those near ECR/CX gates. The new method shows significant enhancements over the existing PadDynamicaDecoupling standard, with promising benchmark results on IBM devices. Additionally, the implementation includes discussions on key parameters like min_joinable_duration to control the insertion of decoupling sequences effectively.']",

It ensures that input parsing functions are consistently applied, eliminating discrepancies between the `generate_preset_pass_manager` and `transpile` functions. The changes enhance functionality and prevent different outputs for the same inputs, improving overall reliability. The PR has been approved and merged into the main branch.']",

The code is very clean and I very much like that it uses the new testing framework. I have left a question about the difference between \"1_clean\" and \"2_clean\" methods (most probably because I have not actually read the paper) and a few suggestions on improving the release notes. I have also briefly experimented with the code and saw that the new 1-clean method adds less 2-qubit gates than the old 1-clean method (which makes it a very useful contribution).

The updates aim to improve the efficiency of quantum circuits by reducing the number of CX gates required. In addition to the implementation, new test cases have been added to verify the functionality and correctness of these methods. This contribution addresses issue #13913 and is a significant step forward in the synthesis capabilities of Qiskit.']",

I agree this issue is a bit tricky but I think your contribution is going into the right direction. :-) Also, thanks for exploring different options for that issue!\nI did not have time yet to look into your code but wanted to spend the time to clarify some of your questions. To give a little bit of context, the output of this procedure will likely not be executed directly on a quantum computer but will prove valuable for investigating compiler capabilities and efficiencies. The problem I wanted to fix with the depth parameter is that the given input graph may not be observed by random_circuit_from_graph  otherwise. Likely the name of depth is not optimal and should be replaced by something like min_2q_gate_per_edge.\nYou rightfully noted that the generated circuits may become quite large but I think this is fine. I suspect that if you have N edges in the input graph and uniformly draw 10*N random edges from your input graph, you are pretty much guaranteed to have drawn every edge at least one. While this implies that the circuit depth of the random circuit can be 10*N occasionally, the circuit depth should be much smaller in practice, depending on the structure of the input graph. If an user decides to assign non-uniform weights to the input graph edges, they will need to accept that the returned random circuit will be deeper.\nI think it would be a good idea to raise an error with a reasonable error message if some of the edge weights are none while others are not none. If all edge weights are none, you can assume the weight of each edge to be 1/N.\nWith respects to resets and conditional operations, you can simply follow the approach given in the original random_circuit function, i.e. meaning make some operations conditional with some probability and regard resets as single-qubit gates.\nSome of your 'reviewer markers'  should actually be comments in your code, it would be great if you add those as you see fit. :-)\nI think the implementation should eventually consider the edge weight as well as consider the depth/min_2q_gate_per_edge parameter, e.g. guarantee that the returned random circuit actually has the interaction graph specified by interaction_graph when depth/min_2q_gate_per_edge is set to one.\nI like the idea to fill unused qubits in a layer with a single-qubit gate if insert_1q_oper is set and otherwise do not use single-qubit gates at all. However, a layer should consist of multiple two-qubit gates (even though the number of two-qubit gates does not have be maximal in each layer). You are also right about max_operands - it is confusing in the way the issue is currently stated. In the future, one might want to include 3-qubit or 4-qubit gates but currently for this issue only two-qubit gates and optional single-qubit gates should be used.\nLet me know if things became clearer and whether you require any other information. Also, if you make modifications to your PR, let me know for which implementation you went for eventually. :-)\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

I also think there should be a couple of more test cases with different types of interaction graphs such as sparse graphs, (almost) fully connected and a couple more random ones. Also, I think it would be best if you reused the code in other test cases instead of copying them.

Now with random_circuit almost back to its original state, I gave a more thorough look at the other parts. Please see my line comments. I hope this will be the last round of changes before we can merge the PR.\nRegarding your performance comparison, it was helpful. It does help with getting a rough sense for the scaling of random_circuit_from_graph compared to random_circuit. If we want at some point to get a better understanding of it, we'll need to explore the parameter space more rigorously. For example, I played with your code a bit and got this:\nqc = random_circuit_from_graph(h_h_g,\n                               min_2q_gate_per_edge = 90,\n                               max_operands = 2,\n                               measure = True,\n                               conditional = False, # Just making it a bit more challenging.\n                               reset = False,\n                               seed = seed,\n                               insert_1q_oper = True)\nqc_rand = random_circuit(num_qubits = 70, depth = 298, max_operands = 2, measure = True, conditional = False, reset = False, seed = seed)\n# For `random_circuit_from_graph`:\n# Time taken: 1.6271507740020752 to generate 19729 operations\n# Time taken per operation: 82.47507597962772 us\n#  ########################################\n# For `random_circuit`:\n# Time taken: 0.5127830505371094 to generate 19067 operations\n# Time taken per operation: 26.893745766880443 us\nBut still it's good to have some sense that the new function is not too far off. I've left a couple optimization suggestions that might help but I wouldn't go beyond that in this PR trying to optimize performance more. We can handle this aspect in a new PR if there will be a use-case for which performance becomes a bottleneck.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

So QuantumCircuit._append could not be used within a control-flow builder context (e.g. within with qc.if_test) since it doesn't look at the current circuit scope, effectively ignoring the control-flow scope here. This is why we don't see the if test surrounding the CS gate.\nSo let's keep the qc.append inside all the control-flow build contexts here and use qc._append elsewhere.

I was able to fix the linting issues but I have a question about the testing. When I run tox I can see one failure when test_random_mid_circuit_measure_conditional function is checked. I think the problem arises because seed=4 yields a different random circuit than it used to for old code. I know how to fix that issue (by changing seed =4 to seed =16 to produce a similar circuit), should I make this change and include it in my PR or should I not change other tests?\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

Please reload this page.\n \n \n \nSorry for the multiple commits, but I am facing an issue with runnin tox - elint locally (I have opened an issue in qiskit regarding that).\n@sbrandhsn I have addressed your comments in my recent commits. Here are some details about the changes:\nThere are formatting issues which causes our CI to fail. Please run tox -eblack and tox -elint-incr locally to figure out what needs to be changed.\nI have fixed the linting and code formatting issues. The CI is able to run all the tests successfully.\nI think I made a mistake when specifying the precedence of max_operands, sorry! Having both set, max_operands and num_operand_distribution set is fine, please revert the initial default value of max_operands. If num_operand_distribution is not set but max_operands is set, draw a random num_operand_distribution and continue with your code or use the initial code.\nNow my code won't raise error when both num_operand_distribution and max_operands are set. And if both are set the code will use the distribution specified in num_operand_distribution. And the max_operands will use the default value 4 (according to the original code).\nPlease add a test case with a distribution that disallows single-qubit gates, i.e. with {1:0, …}. I think some logic around how single-qubit gates are used to fill the non-used qubits in layer would fail such a test case with the current code.\nIn my earlier code if {1: 0, ...} is specified explicitly then: 1) the distribution list will have 0 probability corresponding to the 1-qubit gates in  gates_to_consider and so the np.choice(..., p=distribution) will never pick the 1-qubit gates. 2) To handle how the non-used qubits are filled, I have a slack handling loop, which will only add gates that have a non-zero probability in num_operand_distribution. I have extensively tested these two logics and have also written a test to confirm this. But if you still think this needs to be changed then let me know.\nPlease add a test case with some distribution and specify a particularly long depth as a parameter. This should make your num_operand_distribution match closely what is contained in the returned random circuit.\nI have added three more tests (total 4) which will test if the code respects the num_operand_distribution or not by checking if there are any unwanted gates in the circuit or not.\nAlso, you can fixing that failing test case in the described way seems fine to me. :-)\nI have fixed this test.\nQuestion\nPlease raise an error when max_operands is larger than num_qubits.\nI have commented this above where you originally asked this. But this is how the original code handled when max_operands is larger than num_qubits. Should I still raise an error when this happens? I am asking this because the using max_operands=4 (which was its default value in original code) as the default value, the code will always throw error for num_qubits<4 when user calls random_circuit(num_qubits=3, depth=3). And this is how most of the users call random_circuits() i.e. without ever specifying max_operands.\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

I was wondering whether you have an idea on why the ratios of 1-q and 4-q gates have a larger distance to the specified distribution than 2-q and 3-q gates. :-)\n@sbrandhsn I'm not exactly sure why we are seeing this but here is what I think. The larger distance between 1-q and 4-q gates is because it is easier to fit in 1-q gates and harder to fit in 4-q gates using the current implementation. The function np.cumsum truncates the randomly drawn gate_specs array which will introduce some bias that will lead to the problem we are seeing. And due to this bias the no. of 1-q gates will be almost always be higher than expected and the no. of 4-q gates will be lower than expected. When I wasworking on this issue I did try to come up with a solution that does not involve truncating the randomly drawn gate_specs array but that will slow the code down quite a bit.\nBut if we look at the distribution of gates for a random circuit with 100 and 500 qubits, what I observed is that distance from the expected distribution decreases.\nqubits=100:\nqubits=500:\nWe will observe a similar trend if we just draw a random distribution from only 1-q, 2-q and 3-q gates (excluding 4-q gates). Below is the plot for that\nHere we see the same issue but with 1-q and 3-q gates.\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

The feature aims to enhance the flexibility of circuit generation and addresses issue #12059. Along with the code changes, new tests have been added, and documentation has been updated to reflect these enhancements.\"]",

However, this format is nominally symengine version specific and will raise an error if there is a mismatch between the version used to generate the payload and what is trying to read it. This became an issue in the recent symengine 0.13 release which started to raise an error when people installed it and tried to load QPY payloads across the versions. This makes the symengine serialization unsuitable for use in QPY because it's supposed to be independent of these kind of concerns, especially when QPY is used in a server-client model where you don't necessarily control the installed environment of symengine.\nTo correctly address this issue we'll need a new version of the QPY format that owns the serialization format of ParameterExpressions directly instead of relying on symengine which doesn't offer a compatibility guarantee on the format. However this won't be quick solution and users are encountering issues since the release of 0.13. This commit introduces a workaround for this specific instance of the mismatch. It turns out the payload format between 0.11 and 0.13 is completely unchanged except for the version number. So before passing the parameter expression payload to symengine for deserialization this commit checks the versions numbers are the same, if they're not it checks that we're dealing with 0.11 or 0.13, and if so it changes the version number in the payloads header appropriately. If the version number is outside those bounds it raises an exception because while this hack is known to be safe for translating between symengine 0.11 and 0.13, it's not possible to know for a future version whether the payload format changed or not.\nLonger term we will need a proper fix in qpy version 13 that introduces a qiskit native serialization format for parameter expression instead of relying on symengine or sympy to do it for us.\nDetails and comments\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

My initial thought was if there is no mismatch I think we're fine as symengine should be totally fine if everything is the same version. I guess it's more a question of whether we think it's sufficiently a risk of foot gunning by generating a payload with 0.14.0 that will fail if someone is using any other version later\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

That's the only option really is either add a cap to the requirements file in 1.2.3, or we do it in the python code so that qpy.dump() fails if you have symenging > 0.14 installed. It might be prudent. I was hesitant to do that in this PR because I was worried about python 3.13 support.

We don't like introducing an upper bound in a patch release, but we've had upper bounds on symengine before, and the hack we're doing to enable compatibility is pretty dangerous, since symengine's deserialisation code can hard crash on malformed payloads.  It feels safer to try and restrict symengine 0.14 from entering (as best as we can), rather than hoping that nothing will break when it's released.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

The last question before I approve:\nThe use_symengine argument to QPY serialisation was introduced in #10820, released in Terra 0.45.0, which allowed symengine>=0.9.  use_symengine=False was the default back then, but it was possible to set use_symengine=True, and if I set that during the QPY file generation, then this branch will fail to load the files.  I can't just add 9 to the allowed minor versions we can load from, because it seems like between 0.9 and 0.11 the format did change, and we segfault symengine if we patch the version.\nAre we prepared to accept this problem as \"good enough\", or do we want to look for anything deeper?  Ideologically it's not nice to call it \"good enough\", but pragmatically I don't think I can see an alternative solution for us in the short term.  Assuming we accept that issue, should we put a \"known issues\" release note in about it, or potentially document it in the QPY documentation about the backwards compatibility guarantees?\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

This became an issue\nin the recent symengine 0.13 release which started to raise an error\nwhen people installed it and tried to load QPY payloads across the\nversions. This makes the symengine serialization unsuitable for use in\nQPY because it's supposed to be independent of these kind of concerns,\nespecially when QPY is used in a server-client model where you don't\nnecessarily control the installed environment of symengine.\nTo correctly address this issue we'll need a new version of the QPY\nformat that owns the serialization format of ParameterExpressions directly\ninstead of relying on symengine which doesn't offer a compatibility\nguarantee on the format. However this won't be quick solution and users\nare encountering issues since the release of 0.13. This commit\nintroduces a workaround for this specific instance of the mismatch. It\nturns out the payload format between 0.11 and 0.13 is completely\nunchanged except for the version number. So before passing the parameter\nexpression payload to symengine for deserialization this commit checks\nthe versions numbers are the same, if they're not it checks that we're\ndealing with 0.11 or 0.13, and if so it changes the version number in\nthe payloads header appropriately. If the version number is outside\nthose bounds it raises an exception because while this hack is known to\nbe safe for translating between symengine 0.11 and 0.13, it's not\npossible to know for a future version whether the payload format changed\nor not.\nLonger term we will need a proper fix in qpy version 13 that introduces\na qiskit native serialization format for parameter expression instead of\nrelying on symengine or sympy to do it for us.\n* Handle schedules too\nThis commit updates the schedule serialization path too, as it was also\ndirectly loading symengine expressions.

This became an issue\nin the recent symengine 0.13 release which started to raise an error\nwhen people installed it and tried to load QPY payloads across the\nversions. This makes the symengine serialization unsuitable for use in\nQPY because it's supposed to be independent of these kind of concerns,\nespecially when QPY is used in a server-client model where you don't\nnecessarily control the installed environment of symengine.\nTo correctly address this issue we'll need a new version of the QPY\nformat that owns the serialization format of ParameterExpressions directly\ninstead of relying on symengine which doesn't offer a compatibility\nguarantee on the format. However this won't be quick solution and users\nare encountering issues since the release of 0.13. This commit\nintroduces a workaround for this specific instance of the mismatch. It\nturns out the payload format between 0.11 and 0.13 is completely\nunchanged except for the version number. So before passing the parameter\nexpression payload to symengine for deserialization this commit checks\nthe versions numbers are the same, if they're not it checks that we're\ndealing with 0.11 or 0.13, and if so it changes the version number in\nthe payloads header appropriately. If the version number is outside\nthose bounds it raises an exception because while this hack is known to\nbe safe for translating between symengine 0.11 and 0.13, it's not\npossible to know for a future version whether the payload format changed\nor not.\nLonger term we will need a proper fix in qpy version 13 that introduces\na qiskit native serialization format for parameter expression instead of\nrelying on symengine or sympy to do it for us.\n* Handle schedules too\nThis commit updates the schedule serialization path too, as it was also\ndirectly loading symengine expressions. The code handling the workaround\nis extracted to a standalone function which is used in both spots now\ninstead of calling symengine directly.\n* Remove unused imports\n* Gracefully handle failure to parse historical symengine files\nDuring the discovery on the fix in this PR we discovered that setting\nthe ``use_symengine`` flag from Qiskit 0.45.x and 0.46.x would result in\nnewer versions of Qiskit being unable to parse the QPY file for the same\nissue as being addressed here. This commit expands the logic to account\nfor this and raise a useful warning. It also updates the release notes\nand documentation to document these limitations.\n* Cap upper version of symengine in requirements list\nOut of an abundance of caution this commit places a cap on the allowed\nversion of symengine users can install to be compatible with Qiskit.\nDue to the symengine version dependence discovered in QPY around\nserializing ParameterExpressions, we'll likely have a similar issue\nwhen symengine 0.14.0 releases. Pre-emptively capping this means we\naren't going to be in this situation until we can confirm compatibility\nwith QPY serialization. The real solution for this will come in Qiskit#13252,\nalthough as this behavior is embedded in QPY formats 10, 11, and 12 at\nthis point we'll have to handle this edge case moving forward regardless\nof whether we introduce a better solution in 1.3.0 or not. Although\nrealistically in that case we will likely need to just document this as\na limitation when exporting QPY payloads with Qiskit 0.45.0 through\n1.2.3 (and with the ``version`` flag set to >= 10 and < 13) and have\nexplicit error checking around the symengine version (which this PR\nadds) when in that code path.\n* Fix release note upgrade section label\n* Rewrite support documentation\n* Fix mistakes in release note\nCo-authored-by: Matthew Treinish <mtreinish@kortar.org>\n---------\nCo-authored-by: Jake Lishman <jake.lishman@ibm.com>\nCo-authored-by: Jake Lishman <jake@binhbar.com>\nElePT \n      pushed a commit\n        to ElePT/qiskit\n      that referenced\n      this pull request\n    \nOct 7, 2024\n \n \nFix bug in QPY symengine payload version handling (Qiskit#13259)\n…\n40e7521\nThis commit fixes a bug that slipped into the sole fix that made up\nthe now yanked 1.2.3 release, Qiskit#13251.

To solve\nthe issue moving forward a qiskit native representation of the parameter\nexpression object is necessary for serialization.\nThis commit bumps the QPY format version to 13 and adds a new\nserialization format for ParameterExpression objects.

This internal list is what gets serialized by QPY and then on\ndeserialization the \"replay\" is replayed to reconstruct the expression\nobject. This is a different approach to the previous QPY representations\nof the ParameterExpression objects which instead represented the internal\nstate stored in the ParameterExpression object with the symbolic\nexpression from symengine (or a sympy copy of the expression). Doing\nthis directly in Qiskit isn't viable though because symengine's internal\nexpression tree is not exposed to Python directly. There isn't any\nmethod (private or public) to walk the expression tree to construct\na serialization format based off of it. Converting symengine to a sympy\nexpression and then using sympy's API to walk the expression tree is a\npossibility but that would tie us to sympy which would be problematic\nfor Qiskit#13267 and Qiskit#13131, have significant runtime overhead, and it would\nbe just easier to rely on sympy's native serialization tools.\nThe tradeoff with this approach is that it does increase the memory\noverhead of the `ParameterExpression` class because for each element\nin the expression we have to store a record of it. Depending on the\ndepth of the expression tree this also could be a lot larger than\nsymengine's internal representation as we store the raw api calls made\nto create the ParameterExpression but symengine is likely simplifying\nit's internal representation as it builds it out.

         "['This PR introduces a workaround for symengine serialization payload incompatibility in Qiskit. It addresses issues caused by the recent symengine 0.13 release, which raised errors due to version mismatches when loading QPY payloads. The workaround checks version compatibility and modifies the payload header accordingly to handle versions 0.11 and 0.13. It also includes updates to handle schedule serialization and ensures graceful handling of historical symengine files. Furthermore, the upper version of symengine is capped in the requirements to prevent future compatibility issues until a permanent solution can be implemented in QPY version 13.']",

The consolidate blocks internal logic around whether to consolidate a pass or not is based on the estimate from the selected decomposer of whether the estimated number of gates used to synthesis the unitary would exceed the number of basis gates in the block. To do this the pass counts the gate with the synthesis target name in the block. However, in the case of the decomposer being the TwoQubitBasisDecomposer the name being used for this look wasn't the name of the gate, but instead was an internal sentinel value string \"USER_GATE\" which is used to handle arbitrary user gate definitions in the decomposer. This led to the consolidate blocks pass missing opportunities for consolidation. This commit fixes the oversight so that the name we use for making this determination is the actual basis gate name and the pass functions correctly.\nDetails and comments\nFixes #14413\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

         "[\"This pull request fixes a bug in the ConsolidateBlocks pass of Qiskit's transpiler, which was introduced in a previous update. The issue was due to the incorrect use of an internal sentinel value instead of the actual KAK gate name, leading to missed consolidation opportunities. The fix ensures that the correct gate name is utilized, thus restoring the intended functionality of the pass. This change is crucial for optimizing gate counts during quantum circuit transpilation.\"]",

A couple of passes, but not all, have defensive code in their run methods to raise a better error in this case, but even so, there is an assumption that passes will not be run with coupling_map=None.\nThe preset pass managers do follow this assumption; conditional code prevents those passes from ever being called.  However, we know that there's no coupling map ahead of time, so we can simply not even construct the layout passes, let alone add them to the PassManager.\nDetails and comments\nInput normalisation typically wants to be done in pass initialisation, not deferred to runtime (though expensive properties can still be computed only on first run and cached).  The current strategy of silently ignoring invalid inputs until runtime makes it harder to do this; it's clearer to have the pass-manager construction logic never produce objects in invalid states in the first place.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

When the pass is looking up the preferred synthesis direction for a unitary based on the connectvity constraints the connectivity was being provided as a PyList. To look up the edge in connectivity set this meant we needed to iterate over the list and then create a set that rust could lookup if it contains an edge or it's reverse. This has significant overhead because its iterating via python and also iterating per decomposition. This commit addresses this by changing the input type to be a HashSet from Python so Pyo3 will convert a pyset directly to a HashSet once at call time and that's used by reference for lookups directly instead of needing to iterate over the list each time.\nDetails and comments\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

Profiling the benchpress test using the hamlib\nhamiltonian:\nham_graph-2D-grid-nonpbc-qubitnodes_Lx-5_Ly-186_h-0.5-all-to-all\nthat caught this originally regression was showing an inordinate amount\nof time being spent in the construction of\n`_build_gate_lengths_by_qubit` and `_build_gate_errors_by_qubit` which\nisn't being used because this happens internally in rust now. To\nmitigate this overhead this commit migrates the sections computing these\nvalues to the code branch that uses them and not the default plugin\nbranch that uses rust.\n \n \nmtreinish\n            commented\n            \nOct 29, 2024\n \nView reviewed changes\n \n \ncrates/accelerate/src/unitary_synthesis.rs\n@@ -268,7 +268,7 @@ fn py_run_main_loop(\n                    new_ids,\n                    min_qubits,\n                    target,\n                    coupling_edges,\n                    coupling_edges.clone(),\n \n      \n            Copy link\n \n \nMember\nAuthor\nmtreinish\nOct 29, 2024\nThere was a problem hiding this comment.\nChoose a reason for hiding this comment\n      The reason will be displayed to describe this comment to others.

Not sure how important this is because this only comes up during control flow processing and we're already slower there because of the python usage and circuit to dag conversion. Maybe something to fix for when we make a dag native control flow op.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

The new function names, such as synth_mcx_n_dirty_i15, synth_mcx_1_clean_b95, etc. are reasonable. One small question: once we integrate these into plugins, would it make sense for the plugin names to be n_dirty_i15, 1_clean_b95, etc. as in hls = HLSConfig(mcx=['1_clean_b95`])?\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

However the way the target was being used in this check was incorrect. The name for an instruction in the target should be used as its identifier and then if we need the object representation that should query the target for that object based on the name. However the check was doing this backwards getting a list of operation objects and then using the name contained in the object. This will cause issues for instructions that use custom names such as when there are tuned variants or a custom gate instance with a unique name.\nWhile there is some question over whether we need this check as we will run the consolidate 2q blocks pass as part of the optimization stage which will have the same effect, this opts to just fix the target usage for it to minimize the diff. Also while not the explicit goal of this check it is protecting against some bugs in the consolidate blocks pass that occur when custom gates are used. So for the short term this check is retained, but in the future when these bugs in consolidate blocks are fixed we can revisit whether we want to remove the conditional logic.\nDetails and comments\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

Realistically, the piece that's actually needed here is actually the known check; it's protecting us against issues running ConsolidateBlocks with custom operations that it can't reason about. I need to open another bug about ConsolidateBlocks crashing with custom opaque gates so we can track fixing that too..\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

         "[\"This pull request (#12898) removes an incorrectly implemented check in the initialization peephole optimization for Qiskit. The check was meant to avoid running 2-qubit gate consolidation in the presence of discrete gates but was flawed as it misused the target's operation objects. The PR simplifies the logic by eliminating the check and fixing an underlying bug in the ConsolidateBlocks logic, which previously caused issues with custom gates. This change enhances the optimization process while maintaining system stability.\"]",

Here we are appending the quantum circuit mcmt  to the quantum circuit circuit, yet the docstring for append states instruction: Operation | CircuitInstruction. The code does work, since a QuantumCircuit defines a to_instruction method, which append tries to use when the instruction is not of type Operation. Would it be slightly cleaner to change to circuit.append(mcmt.to_instruction(), ...), or should we change the typehint for the append method?\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

         "['This pull request (#13596) by Cryoris introduces a crucial fix by ensuring that the MCMT plugin is only applied to the MCMTGate, thus preventing erroneous behavior when the circuit named \"mcmt\" is used. This change addresses issue #13563 and includes updates to the changelog under the \"Fixed\" section. The implementation also enhances the testing framework, ensuring robustness around the usage of the MCMT gate. Overall, this PR improves the functionality and clarity of the Qiskit framework.']",

Prior to QPY version 10 this was the only way we supported serializing parameter expressions in QPY. For QPY version 10, 11, and 12 sympy could optionally be used if the payload was generated explicitly to not use symengine (in qiskit 1.0 it defaulted to use symengine).\nThis serialization format relied on sympy to generate a string representation of the expression which we then put in the payload. On deserialization we called sympy's parse_expr() function which internally is calling sympy's sympify() internally. Sympy documents that sympify() relies on Python's eval() for string input and should not be used with untrusted input. But parse_expr() didn't have such a warning (at the time, I plan to contribute adding one), so using this function provides an avenue for arbitrary code execution during QPY deserialization.\nThis commit fixes this issue by writing a custom parser for the string representation in a QPY payload based on python's ast module. This parser walks the abstract syntax tree and builds the sympy expression object as it it goes. It is restricted to the operations that ParameterExpression supports and if any part of the string tries to use functionality outside that set it will error.\nDetails and comments\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

To\nsimplify the PR to just the working component this commit removes the\nfile. We can add it back in the future when there is use case for the\nmodule.\n* Change py suffix to prefix\nThis commit just renames the symbol_expr_py file and module to\npy_symbol_expr. We typically use a Py prefix when describing objects\nthat are just for python. This change was just done to make this new\nmodule match that expectation.\n* Fix qiskit-circuit cargo dependencies\nThe Cargo.toml for qiskit-circuit was missing some details to use the\napprox crate correctly with Complex64 types and arrays of those types.\nThis didn't bubble up in combined builds because cargo was reusing the\ncompilation unit for these crates with accelerate which had the correct\nsettings. But when trying to do a standalone build of qiskit-circuit\nthis caused a compilation error. This commit fixes this by updating the\nlocal dependencies to ensure the appropriate features to use approx with\ncomplex and ndarray are set.\n* Use unix style newlines for symbol_parser.rs\n* Remove unused extern crate lines\n* Run cargo fmt\n* add some missing fuction to Python interface\n* fix sqrt\n* add values function to enumerate all values in expression for pi_check.py\n* fix for lint\n* fix for lint error\n* Make conjugate a unary op\nIn testing the conjugate was not working for parameters. This is because\nit was not being treated as a unary op. Values were correctly changing\nthe sign of the complex component, but symbols and expressions would\nnot. To fix this the conjugate was added as a unary op which is tracked\nadded to the expression tree.\n* Add test module for validating all parameter expression ops\nThis commit expands the test coverage for the parameter expression class\nto ensure that we have coverage of all the mathemetical operations that\ncan be performed on an expression and does so with combinations of\noperand types to try and provide more thorough coverage of the class.\nThe only method missing from the tet right now is gradient which can be\nadded later.\n* Add tolerance on new unit tests for multiplication with complex bind\nThis commit adds tolerance to the floating point comparison on the\nmultiplication test with binding a complex number. Running these tests\nin CI was showing failures on different platforms caused by floating\npoint precision differences. This should fix the failures in CI.\n* Fix pow logic for complex numbers\nThe pow logic was overeagerly casting values to complex whenever the lhs of\nthe operation was negative. The output is only complex if the lhs is\nnegative and the rhs has a fractional component. This casting to a\ncomplex was accumulating a small imaginary component because of\nfp precision even though the values shouldn't be complex. This commit\nfixes this issue by adjusting the pow logic to only cast a real or\ninteger value to a complex if it's negative and the rhs has a fractional\ncomponent.\n* Fix more pow impl and expand coverage\n* Remove unused pyfunctions\n* Add more test coverage\n* More test coverage\n* Add tests for .numeric()\n* Add tolerance to test_pow_complex_binding\nThis test was failing in CI on Windows due to differing fp precision.

This commit\nfixes this issue by adjusting the pow logic to only cast a real or\ninteger value to a complex if it's negative and the rhs has a fractional\ncomponent.\n* Fix more pow impl and expand coverage\n* Remove unused pyfunctions\n* Add more test coverage\n* More test coverage\n* Add tests for .numeric()\n* Add tolerance to test_pow_complex_binding\nThis test was failing in CI on Windows due to differing fp precision. To\nfix the failure this adjusts the tests to use assertAlmostEqual instead\nof assertEqual to account for the platform differences.\n* modify SymbolExpr enum structure\n* Fix add/sub optimization\n* Fix PartialOrd for Binary\n* remove Symbol struct, add optimization function and remove on-the-fly optimization\n* add optimization for values, fix equality check\n* remove debug prints\n* reformat for lint test\n* fix cargo error\n* fix for lint\n* fix for lint\n* Fix np.complex128 issue, remove codes for exceptions for np.complex128\n* fix for lint\n* fix for lint\n* Fix symbol_parser.rs, remove BinaryOpContainer, reordering pow operator\n* replace rhs to lhs in __r*__ functions, add multispace0 for unary op parser\n* remove unused imports\n* move replacements of backslashes for sympify into rust\n* fix for lint\n* remove enum for Python multi-types and replace them to PyObject\n* optimize __eq__ when comparing with value\n* remove optimmize() from __hash__\n* rename PySymbolExpr to ParameterExpression and implemented some function so that we can use both from rust and python\n* Fix log and div\n* Expand dedicated ParameterExpression testing\n* Remove unicode charcter to fix windows charmap failure\n* recover value.py as Qiskit#14024\n* lint\n* reflect review comments\n* cargo fmt\n* remove unused imports\n* fix cloning Values\n* format\n* add error handling on parse_expression\n* add exception to is_real when there are unbound parameters\n* Revert \"add exception to is_real when there are unbound parameters\"\nThis reverts commit 1c98127.\n* fix derivative of asin/acos, raise error for sign/conj. Fix sympify with complex numbers\n* restore test_pauli_feature_map, add comment for epsilon\n* format\n* fix for lint\n* remove debug print\n* format\n* Additional tests and gradient note\n- Added a note that the gradient of parameters\n  is only defined for real parameter expressions\n- Added a test to call SparsePauliOp.simplify on\n  with coefficients that have complex multipliers\n- Added numerical checks for derivatives\n* Update crates/circuit/src/parameter_expression.rs\nCo-authored-by: Julien Gacon <gaconju@gmail.com>\n* Update crates/circuit/src/parameter_expression.rs\nCo-authored-by: Julien Gacon <gaconju@gmail.com>\n* Update docs / comments and fix conjugate deriv\n- Update docs: we no longer rely on symengine/sympy for parameters\n- Reword reno: we still install symengine/sympy at this point\n- Fix conjugate derivative: since conj() acts as identity on real numbers, the derivative is 1\n---------\nCo-authored-by: Matthew Treinish <mtreinish@kortar.org>\nCo-authored-by: Julien Gacon <jules.gacon@googlemail.com>\nCo-authored-by: Julien Gacon <gaconju@gmail.com>\n \nSign up for free\nto join this conversation on GitHub.\n    Already have an account?\n    Sign in to comment\n    Reviewers\n  \n \nElePT\nElePT approved these changes\n    Assignees\n  \n \nElePT\n \n    Labels\n  \nChangelog: Bugfix\nInclude in the \"Fixed\" section of the changelog\npriority: high\n    Projects\n  \n    None yet\n \n    Milestone\n  \n \n2.1.0\n    Development\n  \nSuccessfully merging this pull request may close these issues.\n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

         "[\"This pull request (#14024) introduces a custom parser for parameter expression payloads in QPY, replacing the existing `sympy` `parse_expr()` usage, which posed security risks due to reliance on Python's `eval()` function. The new parser utilizes Python's `ast` module to construct `sympy` expressions safely, restricting operations to those supported by `ParameterExpression`. This change enhances security during QPY deserialization and addresses potential vulnerabilities associated with untrusted input. The pull request also includes simplifications in visitor logic and sanity checks to ensure safe operation.\"]",

This is quite common in high-throughput cases, where the circuit is being used as a parametric template for a backend compiler.\nDetails and comments\nSimilar to #13342, this was a couple of very easy tweaks I could make within Python space to slightly improve the runtime performance of the OQ3 importer.  It's still pretty slow for what it does, but there's little point focussing on its performance while it's still pure Python, and the majority of our data models are moving to Rust.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

The modifications target the common case of circuits with numerous singly parametric 1-qubit gates, optimizing runtime for high-throughput applications. While the changes enhance performance, the author notes that the pure Python implementation still limits overall speed, with a future shift towards Rust-based models anticipated.']",

In order to save PrimitiveJob objects locally we need a way to serialize them. It's currently not serializable due to the use of ThreadPoolExecutor:\nqiskit/qiskit/primitives/primitive_job.py\n        Lines 47 to 48\n      in\n      35d0954\n executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=1)  # pylint: disable=consider-using-with \n self._future = executor.submit(self._function, *self._args, **self._kwargs) \nCredit to @t-imamichi\nDetails and comments\nAlso fixes #12787\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

I believe this could be executed on one of the methods, avoiding that function call. You could include the lines here and override one of the reserved methods for serialization: __reduce__, __getstate__, __getnewargs__, depending on your needs.\nNote: This might require you to also implement a __setstate__ method.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

This is because, unlike DAGOpNode, the in and out nodes do not have a name or qargs attribute.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

One can thus compute the causal light cone of the circuit and measurement, i.e. the set of gates that does affect the measurement. This transpiler pass provides an easy tool to reduce the number of gates in our circuit provided a Pauli observable to be measured or  a subset of measurements in the Z basis.\nThis PR adresses  #12792\nDetails and comments\nThis code takes inspiration from an implementation done by @aeddins-ibm.\nBefore finishing the unit-tests for this PR it would be interesting to solve #12790 .\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

A one circuit in, many circuits out, is not currently supported in the transpiler interface.

That would e.g. allow to decompose a larger observable into smaller (e.g. ZZZ... into Z0, Z1, ...) -- this would give a larger light cone since now things might not commute which would in the bigger observable, but it would make the commutation check faster (which I think would use a matrix multiplication check for non-standard gates).\nBut that's probably not required for the beginning and we could just issue a warning if the commutation check becomes problematic 🙂\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

This is linked to #13828. How should we proceed? Do we wait until the issue is fixed for merging this PR, or should we just throw a warning for now if the Pauli string gets too big?\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

         "['The Light Cone Transpiler Pass has been implemented to optimize quantum circuits by determining the causal light cone, allowing for the removal of gates that do not impact measurement outcomes. This PR addresses issue #12792 and enhances the efficiency of circuit transpilation. It provides a tool to simplify circuits based on a specified Pauli observable or a subset of Z basis measurements. The implementation includes a focus on unit tests and acknowledges the need to resolve issue #12790 before finalizing tests.']",

         "[\"This pull request, titled 'Do not retain and expose old elements of ParameterVector', resolves issue #12541 as per the review in #12545. It modifies the handling of `ParameterVector` to prevent the retention and exposure of outdated elements, particularly during deserialization processes. This change is relevant to the core of the `QuantumCircuit` class, and while no new features are introduced, it ensures better management of parameters. A test was also fixed in the process.\"]",

Right now in Qiskit the only valid Backend subclass is BackendV2 so this other code path is never executable. This commit simplifies this method so that only the BackendV2 code path exists. However, the signature is not changed for backwards compatibility, which is something we'll need to manage if/when a BackendV3 is added.\nDetails and comments\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

         "['This pull request (#14275) simplifies the `InstructionDurations` class in Qiskit by removing an unexecutable code path that related to the now-removed BackendV1. The `.from_duration()` method has been updated so that it only handles the BackendV2 case, thereby cleaning up the codebase. The method signature remains unchanged to ensure backward compatibility as the project may expand to include a BackendV3 in the future. This change contributes to better code maintenance and clarity.']",

Could I please see the depth table for MCX? I have a feeling that's why mine is different.\nAlthough, I just upgraded my qiskit to latest version, and it gives the exact same depth as I do.\nfrom qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile\nqc = QuantumCircuit(10)\nqc.mcx(list(range(9)), 9)\nqc = transpile(qc, basis_gates=['cx', 'u3'])\nqc.depth()\n>>> 703\nwhich becomes 705 when sandwiched between sdg and s.\nOHH.

Please reload this page.\n \n \n \nSummary\nThis rewrites the symbol handling of the OpenQASM 3 exporter to decouple object identities from the necessary object identifiers.  As part of this, we use the same trick of standard-gate reparametrisation to produce gate-definition sources for Qiskit built-ins, which fixes many cases of bad parametrisation of gates like rzx.\nThis kind of rewrite was necessary to fix the now-bad assumption within the OQ3 exporter that \"gate identity\" is always static within a circuit. Since standard gate Gate instances are now only generated on demand, there is no guarantee of stability of them.  The fix to the definition source for these makes them independent of object identity. User-defined gates can still use the identity, as these are still guaranteed static.\nThis commit fixes almost all of the \"bad parametrisation\" tests in the test suite.  There are several other changes in the test suite necessary:\nsince the uniqueness of the identifier is now independent of how the lookup of a Qiskit object works, there is no need to include the highly non-deterministic id in the generated symbols for user gates. Several tests changed to use the new, simple count-based unique names.\nthe escaping and uniqueness rules now apply uniformly to all gate definitions, fixing several bad test cases that previously were testing invalid OpenQASM 3.\nthe escaping rules changed slightly for naming collisions with keywords, making them slightly more consistent with how other renaming rules worked.\nDetails and comments\nThis unblocks #12730 by fixing the broken assumption about object identity for standard gates.\nFix Some internal polishing is needed in the QASM3 exporter #7136 (not to say it's perfect now, but this addresses all the problems tracked by that issue).\nFix QASM 2 and 3 exporters do not handle parameterised gates correctly #7335\nFix QASM 3 exporter makes multiple definitions for same gate #9428\nFix qasm3 returns wrong results with pauli evolution gate #11954\nFix Basis gate set with RXX gate converted with QASM3 and run with Aer simulator results in 'unknown instruction: rxx_139974866104288' #11560\nFix  Qiskit’s OpenQASM 3 exporter: not correctly escaping the names of custom gates it’s defining #11761\nSupersede Make fewer accesses, instruction.operation, in exporter.py #12481\nThis fixes the underlying bug that PR 12481 was attempting to address, though reducing the use of instruction.operation as that PR does could still be a benefit to performance.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

I suppose you'd have attach a type or other label to each object, in order to do this. But I don't see a lot of types otherwise.

The fix to the definition\nsource for these makes them independent of object identity.\nUser-defined gates can still use the identity, as these are still\nguaranteed static.\nThis commit fixes almost all of the \"bad parametrisation\" tests in the\ntest suite.

We can't actually do that, though, because the prior call to assign_parameters erases the original parametric definition, so we can't find it again.  The test as written doesn't use p0 or p1.\nWith this PR, this \"bad\" behaviour is only limited to custom user gates, though, so it's not such a huge deal anymore, as it's rather less likely to come up in practice.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

         "['This pull request rewrites the symbol handling of the OpenQASM 3 exporter to decouple object identities from necessary object identifiers. It addresses several issues, including fixing bad parameterization of gates like `rzx`, and ensures that gate definitions are now independent of object identity. The changes resolve multiple bugs related to parameterized gates and improve the escaping and uniqueness rules for gate definitions. This PR fixes many \"bad parameterization\" tests and enhances overall functionality, while also unblocking issue #12730.']",

It might look like a lot of changes but I mostly moved around existing code (the one you already reviewed). As a summary:\nI restructured the Rust file to try to make it more understandable and reduce code repetition, I also added comments.\nOn the Python side, I moved the DefaultUnitarySynthesis plugin code to an independent file. This plugin duplicates the Rust logic, which unfortunately was developed in parallel to the plugin infrastructure. The Rust code combines the pass run_main_loop logic with the plugin run and currently cannot simply replace the plugin run. Ideally, we could yet again refactor the code to match the plugin infrastructure, but I don't think this will be possible before 2.0 (in terms of time).\nFor reference, the Python DefaultUnitarySynthesis class is still set as a fallback for the case where a custom plugin fails, which is the reason why I haven't removed it either. At least separating it from UnitarySynthesis might explain a bit better the situation.\n 👍\n1\n ShellyGarion reacted with thumbs up emoji\n \nAll reactions\n👍\n1 reaction\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

I might be missing something even more basis here, doesn't UnitarySynthesis pass by default call the DefaultSynthesisPlugin?\nAnd special thanks adding code comments, this helped me a lot to understand what each different function does.\nI am approving it, but I think there were also some review comments from @ShellyGarion.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

To answer your question, the code shouldn't be duplicated. The reason why it is is that at the time the unitary synthesis code was originally oxidized, we didn't have any reference of how to interact with the plugin infrastructure, and because we only had 1 unitary synthesis plugin (the infrastructure wasn't really taken advantage of), we went for the path of replicating the whole flow in rust. In hindsight it would be way more modular to have only the plugin run method in rust, but implementing this now requires a refactoring that I didn't have the time to prioritize yet. Once you finish the HLS oxidization it might also be a good idea to try to make unitary synthesis is pluggable in the HLS workflow. This is something I briefly discussed with @Cryoris. The TL:DR is: not enough information at the time, not enough time to fix it when the information was clear.\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

Previously the function could be called with fewer qubits available and the synthesized quantum circuit was not guaranteed to fit into the original quantum circuit leading to internal errors in HighLevelSynthesis pass.\nThird, it adds the default synthesis plugin for FullAdderGate and improves the default synthesis plugins for HalfAdderGate and ModularAdderGate to always choose the best synthesis method depending on the number of ancillas available. Previously, we were getting less optimal circuits for certain small values of n.\nDetails and comments\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

         "['This PR (Pull Request #13530) implements minor fixes and enhancements for the adder and multiplier gate classes (FullAdderGate, HalfAdderGate, ModularAdderGate, and MultiplierGate) in Qiskit. Key changes include the addition of the _define method to allow construction of Operators from circuits with these gates, fixes to plugins for adder gates ensuring proper use of ancilla qubits, and improvements to synthesis methods for optimal circuit generation. The PR also includes added tests for scenarios where adder plugins do not apply. Overall, these changes enhance the functionality and performance of quantum circuits using these gates.']",

It will also call SparseObservable.simplify for every observable.\n The methods __array__, __getitem__, and tolist will return mappings, as today.\n __repr__ will return the same string as it does now.\nDetails and comments\nOther items of ObservablesArray to be based on SparseObservable #14129 will be done in subsequent or parallel PRs, I'm trying to maximize the number of PRs.\nCurrently WIP - the first commit only performs modifications to tests, without yet writing new tests and without implementation.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

I don't understand the reason for the switch either, because one still has __array__ and can do np.array(obs_array[...]) to get the actual matrix.\nFor example,\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3]\nmy_list[::2] # returns list\nmy_list[0] # returns int\nmy_array = np.linspace(0, 1, 100)\nmy_array[::2] # returns np.ndarray\nmy_array[0] # returns np.float64\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

         "['This PR (#14132) aims to replace the internal representation of `ObservablesArray` with `SparseObservable`. Key modifications include updating the `coerce_observable` method to ensure all entries in `ObservablesArrayLike._array` are of type `SparseObservable` and calling `SparseObservable.simplify` for each observable. The methods `__array__`, `__getitem__`, and `tolist` will continue to return mappings, while `__repr__` will maintain its current string output. The PR is currently a work in progress, with initial changes focusing on modifying tests without implementing new features yet. Ongoing discussions suggest considerations around backward compatibility and functionality impacts.']",

Key changes include updated settings that cater to a broader range of graph classes and the removal of graph attributes when specific conditions are met. The PR comprises 12 commits and aims to ensure better visual clarity and representation in quantum circuit graph layouts.']",

Please reload this page.\n \n \n \nThese changes were needed to get the qiskit-experiments tests to pass in this PR that moves all circuit execution from Backend.run to SamplerV2.run, making use of BackendSamplerV2 as the translation layer. We can add a release note and a test if needed but I wanted to see if these changes would be acceptable or not first. There are a couple other related issues/questions I had:\nRight now, BackendSamplerV2 accepts an options dict and unpacks it into its Options class. These options are then passed through to Backend.run (except shots that is passed through only if it not overridden). This mechanism means that support for any additional arguments also requires changing the Options class again. Could all the options just be passed through besides shots?\nSecondary request to the previous one -- I can see why keeping to the Options format is more standard so it might not be acceptable to accept and pass through all options. If so, could we change the __init__ to filter the keys in options and only pass the ones through to Options that have defined fields and warn about the ones that do not? This would make it a little easier to add new options in the future without breaking support for previous versions of Qiskit since an option not in the older Options definition will cause Options(**options) to fail and Options being a non-public class it is not supported to peak at its fields and filter before passing the options (edit: one could create a dummy BackendSamplerV2 and check its options fields and use them to filter the options for the real BackendSamplerV2 without accessing a private class).\nCaveat to the previous points -- maybe we won't need to add support for any more backend run options.\nFor the qiskit-experiments tests, I also needed to delete this line:\nqiskit/qiskit/primitives/backend_estimator.py\n         Line 63\n      in\n      9a1d8d3\n circ.metadata = {} \nIs there any way to work around that issue? Can we revisit if the metadata still needs to be blanked out like that or could we pass through some kind of keep_metadata option? The qiskit-experiments test backends use the metadata to determine what results to return for the circuits. We can look into how to refactor the experiments tests to get the metadata a different way if not.\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

Pydot 3 stores them in declaration order.

I guess the open question is did you want to throw a test version constraint on > 3.0.0 and leave the optional requirement at whatever the current minimum is? It doesn't matter too much so feel free to just enqueue this for merging if you're fine leaving the minimum for testing unchanged.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

Updating the handling of text fields (like labels) that now require values to be enclosed in quotes if they contain special characters.\\n\\nWhile the tests are updated to reflect the new behavior of pydot 3.0, Qiskit remains compatible with pydot 2 for general usage.']",

The Var type was not handled in the attribute callback functions for nodes and edges. This was causing the visualizer to fail if the dag contained these types.

I'm not a big fan of image diff tests, and in this case will be very tricky for me to write because I have a newer version of graphviz installed locally and none of the existing graphviz based visualization tests pass locally.\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

         "['This pull request (#12848) addresses a bug in the DAG visualization for Qiskit that affected the handling of classical variable types (Var). The issue arose because the Var type was not properly managed in the attribute callback functions for nodes and edges, leading to visualization failures when these types were present in the DAG. The fix includes explicit handling for Var types and utilizes the name attribute of the Var object to ensure proper visualization. Additionally, release notes and a test have been added to accompany this improvement.']",

Additionally this fixes an issue where other ops would not appear properly in layers that contained BoxOps. With this PR, a box containing noops disappears since it has a 0 width. If that's an issue, we can create a special case for empty boxes and widen the outside box and include an empty box inside.\nqc = QuantumCircuit(5)\nqc.x(0)\nwith qc.box():\n    qc.x(0)\nwith qc.box():\n    qc.x(0, label=\"xxxxii\")\n    qc.x(0, label=\"xxxxii\")\nqc.x(0)\nwith qc.box():\n    qc.cx(2, 3)\n    with qc.box():\n        qc.noop(4)\nqc.x(2)\nqc.draw(\"mpl\", scale=0.7, style={\"showindex\": True})\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

         "[\"This pull request (PR #14529) improves the BoxOps in Qiskit's visualization by reducing the space inside the boxes and fixing layering issues with other operations. Specifically, it addresses an empty space on the left side of the BoxOps and ensures that operations appear correctly when layered with BoxOps. The changes include 33 commits, with modifications to box sizing and layering logic. This PR resolves issue #14506 and enhances the clarity and functionality of quantum circuit diagrams.\"]",

During the oxidization efforts, unitary_synthesis._decomposer_2q_from_basis_gates was replaced with inline code that didn't contemplate this path (always set a default decomposer), which in the reproducing example led to a longer output circuit (the gates were collected into a unitary block and then decomposed differently).\nDetails and comments\nTechnically not a bugfix because the change wasn't released yet.\nUsing the example shown in the issue ->\nConsolidateBlocks output dag with 1.2.4:\nConsolidateBlocks output dag with 1.3.0rc1:\nConsolidateBlocks output dag after this fix:\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

I remember changing that logic at the time and thinking it wouldn't impact anything. I was coming at it from the mindset that consolidate blocks is too likely to skip consolidation when it shouldn't.\nRealistically we should be relying on the xx decomposer with the rzz in the basis gates list, but there isn't an interface in rust yet to tell us the estimated number of 2q basis gates needed for a unitary, which is why I changed the logic here. Also that is not really a good meteic anyway, just more reason for me to keep working on #13419 and introduce a better approach.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

(because I just re-added it)\nassuming that we don't want to use the XXDecomposer for rzx. What do we want to have then, None or TwoQubitBasisDecomposer(CXGate())?

ConsolidateBlocks tries to guess how many 2q gates will be used to decide whether to consolidate the block into a unitary or not. This is strongly coupled to the behavior of UnitarySynthesis because that's what actually does the synthesis later. But none of this actually takes into account multiple possible decomposers/synthesis methods being supported by a target, or the presence of a non-default plugin being used.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

This might result in some blocks not getting consolidated which were before, but in practice I find it probably pretty unlikely since it only counts rzz gates when evaluating if the block's gates are more than the expected synthesis output.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

Now:\nThe default decomposer is None when no basis_gates/kak_gates are found (same as OG). This includes the rzz gate from the issue [EDIT: didn't work. Reverted that change]\nIf an rxx gate is found, the decomposer will be  the TwoQubitBasisDecomposer with a RXX(pi/2) (same as OG)\nIf an rzx gate is found, the decomposer will be the TwoQubitBasisDecomposer with a CXGate (same as backup decomposer from OG implementation)\nI also added a comment that mentions the previous use of the XXDecomposer for the rzx case for clarity.\n \nAll reactions\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

There might be some subtle differences in what gets consolidated or not with rzx based on differences between XXDecomposer.num_basis_gates and TwoQubitBasisDecomposer's logic, but it should be close enough to the 1.2.x state of the logic that I'm not worried.\nI think this whole exercise reinforces for me how we need to improve the logic around block consolidation. #13419 will do this for the optimization loop, but we will need to think what makes the most sense for when we run ConsolidateBlocks prior to layout in the init stage.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

         "[\"This pull request (#13450) fixes a behavioral change in the `ConsolidateBlocks` component that was introduced in a prior merge (#13368). The implementation restores the original behavior by setting the decomposer to None when kak_gates are not found. Additionally, it adds a test to reproduce the issue and re-adds the 'rzz' gate to the list of supported gates. The changes ensure that the output circuit maintains its expected structure and performance.\"]",

Also added a smaller test which does non-trivial swapping (with swap gates removed using the elide permutation pass) before the unitary test which surfaced a possible bug in the layout composition phase.

Note that just using count_ops is tricky since we have a unitary both before (as the 2-qubit unitary) and after (as two individual 1-qubit unitaries).

I just have a few small comments and questions inline. The biggest one I think is over how/when you're thinking we should integrate this new feature into the preset pass managers.

         "['This PR updates the `Split2QUnitaries` transpiler pass to accommodate SWAP unitary gates, allowing two-qubit unitaries to be decomposed into a SWAP gate and one-qubit gates. It introduces a new processing step that dynamically alters the qubit layout when SWAP gates are detected, optimizing the quantum circuit representation. The changes aim to improve circuit transpilation efficiency and address issue #13476. Additionally, tests have been added to ensure the functionality works as intended. The PR has been reviewed and successfully merged.']",

I mostly had comments about our pickle handling through these cases - I think there's a fair amount of places where we could entirely elide the __getstate__ and __setstate__ calls and do it all through __getnewargs__ (and some places where we're duplicating things already).\nThe other super minor point is whether you think it's worth deferring to Python-space formatting in __repr__ methods.  It's not as fast, but if anything is bottlenecked on __repr__ we should probably make sure it isn't, and using the Python-space formatting means everything will be consistent no matter how deep or shallow in the object hierarchy a __repr__ is called.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

         "['This PR (#12380) ports the `DAGNode` class and its subclasses to Rust, laying the groundwork for efficient implementations of `DAGCircuit` methods. The changes include the addition of 355 lines and the removal of 174 lines across 10 commits. Notably, the `semantic_eq` function was not ported due to dependencies on Python interpreter components. Additionally, unnecessary state methods related to CircuitInstruction pickling have been removed. This work aims to reduce interpreter interaction and improve performance within the Qiskit framework.']",

At the time of this commit it was before the majority of the transpiler infrastructure was ported to rust. At that time the pass was ported we had a few one off passes that were ported to rust and we had to manage the Python rust boundary carefully. The pattern was typically to define custom rust data types that provided an alternate view of the DAGCircuit and the target for compilation that was built out of the Python space dag and target. The star prerouting pass was ported to Rust and leveraged the existing infrastructure used by SabreSwap and SabreLayout as the function of the pass on a DAG was very similar to Sabre (finding where to insert swaps and rebuilding the dag where swaps are needed). At the time this was a pragmatic choice to accelerate the pass and not need to wait for the needed infrastructure to be written in Rust. However in practice the performance gains the Rust porting of the algorithm provided were not as large as was originally hoped and now the code of the pass is tied directly to the current implementation of sabre. As the sabre interface layer is being re-written in #14317 this is proving to be a blocker for that effort. This commit reverts the current rust implementation to unblock the sabre refactoring effort.\nIt's still definitely worth porting this pass to Rust but we now have sufficient infrastructure in Rust to write full transpiler passes without Python. We should follow up this PR and rewrite the star prerouting pass so that full pass operates completely in rust and directly leverages the native data structures that exist in Rust now instead of the hybrid approach that ties the is tightly coupled to the internals of the sabre pass.\nDetails and comments\nThis reverts commit b23c545.\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n        Uh oh!\n There was an error while loading.

         "[\"This pull request reverts the previous attempt to port the star prerouting pass to Rust due to inadequate performance gains and complications arising from its integration with the Sabre interface. The original Rust implementation was a temporary measure that has since become a blocker for necessary refactoring efforts within the Sabre layer. The author notes that sufficient Rust infrastructure is now available, enabling a more effective future rewrite of the star prerouting pass that will fully utilize Rust's capabilities without reliance on Python. This change aims to unblock ongoing development and improve the overall structure of the transpiler.\", 'This PR reverts the prior attempt to port the `star_preroute` pass to Rust due to suboptimal performance gains and complications with the Sabre interface integration.
